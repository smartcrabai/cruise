# ATP vs rsync — real-internet benchmark harness (br-asupersync-iiz6jk)

Measures `atp` against a **maximally tuned** rsync transferring real payloads
between real fleet machines over the open internet (Hetzner → Contabo), with
bit-for-bit SHA-256 verification of every single transfer.

## Methodology (gauntlet rules)

- **Honest baseline first**: every number is reported, including losses. No
  cherry-picking. Network conditions (RTT, optional iperf3 throughput ceiling)
  are recorded alongside results.
- **Toughest-possible rsync**: random payloads are incompressible and the
  destination is always empty, so rsync is configured to skip everything that
  would slow it down:
  - `-aW --inplace` — archive mode, **whole-file** (delta algorithm off — it
    can only lose on fresh random data), in-place writes (no tmp-copy rename).
  - **No `-z`** — compression strictly hurts on `/dev/urandom` payloads.
  - ssh transport tuned: `-T -x -o Compression=no -c aes128-gcm@openssh.com`
    (fastest AEAD cipher commonly available; no TTY, no X11).
  - **`rsyncd` daemon mode** is also measured: plaintext TCP, no ssh crypto at
    all. `atp-quic` is the QUIC/TLS ATP row, `atp-rq` is the authenticated
    RaptorQ/UDP ATP row, `atp-tcp` is the plaintext legacy ATP control row,
    `rsyncd` is the plaintext rsync ceiling, and rsync-over-ssh is the
    authenticated/encrypted rsync row. This is stated in the report rather than
    hidden.
- **3 measured runs + 1 warmup** per (tool × payload). Each cell writes to a
  unique receiver directory under `/root/atp-bench/recv/<run-id>/...`; the
  harness retains artifacts instead of deleting prior runs.
- **Verification**: a SHA-256 manifest is generated at payload creation; after
  EVERY transfer the receiver runs `sha256sum -c` over the manifest. A failed
  verification fails the run (recorded, not discarded).
- **RQ symbol authentication**: `atp-rq` uses a 32-byte symbol-auth key. The
  harness generates one with `atp rq-keygen` per run. To supply an operator key,
  pass `--atp-rq-auth-key-stdin` and pipe exactly one 64-hex-character line into
  the harness. Each local and remote ATP process receives the key through its
  own stdin; in new runs, the key is absent from process arguments,
  environments, SSH command strings, `/usr/bin/time` command records, and
  result artifacts. `atp-quic` instead authenticates every symbol datagram
  through QUIC's TLS 1.3 AEAD and neither needs nor accepts the RQ stdin key.
  The legacy `ATP_RQ_AUTH_KEY_HEX` and `RQ_AUTH_KEY_HEX` environment inputs are
  rejected.

  Before each secret-bearing fleet SSH session, the harness checks the exact
  effective host, options, and remote command with a public stdin canary.
  Ordinary aliases, ProxyJump, and bastions remain supported. Effective paths
  that target fd 0, as well as tokenized (`%...`) identity/certificate paths
  whose final expansion cannot be proven safe, fail closed.

  Artifacts retained from older harness versions can still contain raw
  key-designated values because `/usr/bin/time` recorded the former argv. Audit
  matrix-cell `send.time` / `recv.time`, fleet receiver `recv_time.txt`, and the
  sender `time.txt` beneath each retained `atp_bench_one.*` temp directory.
  Treat those values as expired and compromised, never reuse them, and audit
  both local and fleet retention before sharing old results. This harness
  neither rewrites nor deletes existing artifacts. Its Bash
  overwrite-and-unset cleanup is best effort; it is not a claim of
  cryptographic heap zeroization.
- **Crypto-symmetric reporting**: `report.py` only headlines apples-to-apples
  speedup pairs: `atp-quic`/`atp-rq` against rsync-over-ssh, and the plaintext
  `atp-tcp` control against `rsyncd`.

## Metrics captured

| Metric | Source | Side |
|--------|--------|------|
| Wall clock | `/usr/bin/time -v` | sender + receiver (atp `--once`) |
| Peak RSS | `/usr/bin/time -v` MaxRSS | sender + receiver |
| Avg RSS / %CPU | `sampler.sh` (0.5s `ps` samples) | sender + receiver |
| CPU cycles / instructions | `perf stat` when available, else omitted | sender |
| Per-core utilization | `mpstat -P ALL 1` during run | sender |
| Responsiveness guard | 1-min loadavg sampled; run fails if > configured cap × cores | both |
| Throughput | payload bytes / wall | derived |
| feedback_rounds | ATP sender JSON | ATP rows |

## Files

- `gen_payloads.sh` — run on the **sender**: builds `/root/atp-bench/payloads`
  (512KB/1MB/10MB/100MB/1GB urandom files + heterogeneous nested tree) and
  SHA-256 manifests. Idempotent; if an existing payload does not match its
  manifest, the script fails closed rather than overwriting it.
- `collect_metrics.sh` — background process sampler (`ps`/loadavg → JSONL).
- `run_one.sh` — runs one sender command under `/usr/bin/time -v` (+ `perf
  stat` if present), emits a JSON result line, and retains its temp directory
  path in the `tmp_dir` field.
- `run_bench.sh` — orchestrator (run from the dev box): deploys binaries +
  scripts, iterates payload × tool × run, collects sender+receiver metrics,
  verifies hashes, writes `results.jsonl`.
- `report.py` — aggregates `results.jsonl` → markdown comparison report.

## ATP RQ/QUIC knobs

`atp-quic` and `atp-rq` are included by default. The TCP row remains useful as a
plaintext regression/control comparison while RQ/QUIC work continues.

```bash
--atp-rq-streams 8
--atp-rq-symbol-size 1024
--atp-rq-repair-overhead 1.15
--atp-rq-tail-drain-ms 2
--atp-rq-auth-key-stdin              # optional; read one 64-hex line before setup
--atp-quic-server-name <name-or-ip> # optional; default is receiver host/IP
--atp-quic-handshake-timeout-ms 30000
```

Those non-secret values are recorded in `conditions.json` for every run.
`atp-quic` reuses the RQ symbol size, repair overhead, and tail-drain tuning, but
its authentication boundary is TLS rather than the separate RQ symbol key.
Sweep the tuning values when working on throughput: larger symbols reduce coding
overhead, more streams can help fill the RQ path, and repair overhead trades
network bytes for fewer decode round trips. Tail drain is the receiver-side
quiet window after each fountain round marker; increasing it can prevent false
`NeedMore` rounds on high-RTT paths where control traffic beats queued symbols
to user space.

When `atp-quic` is requested, `run_bench.sh` generates a short-lived self-signed
certificate/key on the receiver under `<base>/runs/<run-id>/quic_tls/`, copies
the certificate to the sender as the CA trust root, and passes `--server-cert`,
`--server-key`, `--ca`, and `--server-name` explicitly. The key is never copied
off the receiver.

`run_bench.sh` also accepts `--run-id <A-Za-z0-9._->` and
`--base <remote-dir>`. Supplying a run id makes reruns easy to correlate across
sender, receiver, and local artifacts. Use `--base` when the sender is not
`root`; the directory must be writable on both machines. Cleanup is
intentionally manual: inspect or archive `<base>/recv/<run-id>` and
`<base>/runs/<run-id>` on the receiver before removing anything.

## Resource Guard

Every benchmark row records a `resource_guard` object with schema
`atp-bench-resource-guard-v1`. The guard evaluates sampled load and optional
RSS caps as a pass/fail artifact, so the G3 responsiveness claim is not inferred
from prose in `report.md`.

```bash
--max-load-per-core 1.5     # default; applies to sender and receiver load1
--max-sender-rss-mb 0       # 0 disables the sender RSS cap
--max-receiver-rss-mb 0     # 0 disables the receiver RSS cap
```

The load cap is enforced before each series and after each measured run. RSS
caps are opt-in because valid ceilings depend on payload/profile size; when set,
the row fails closed if `/usr/bin/time -v` or sampler evidence crosses the cap.

## Usage

```bash
# from the repo root on the dev box
scripts/atp_bench/run_bench.sh \
  --sender hz1 --sender-key ~/.ssh/contabo_vps_ed25519 \
  --receiver vmi1156319 --receiver-key ~/.ssh/contabo_vps_ed25519 \
  --base /home/ubuntu/atp-bench \
  --atp-binary target/release/atp \
  --payloads 512k,1m,10m,100m,1g,tree \
  --tools atp-quic,atp-rq,atp-tcp,rsync-ssh,rsyncd \
  --atp-rq-streams 8 \
  --atp-rq-symbol-size 1024 \
  --atp-rq-repair-overhead 1.15 \
  --atp-rq-tail-drain-ms 2 \
  --run-id atp-rq-open-internet-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ) \
  --runs 3 \
  --out artifacts/atp_bench/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

python3 scripts/atp_bench/report.py artifacts/atp_bench/<date>/results.jsonl \
  > artifacts/atp_bench/<date>/report.md
```

For the netns matrix harness high-BDP UDP fan-out sweep, keep rsync as the
single-stream baseline and sweep ATP-RQ streams explicitly:

```bash
scripts/atp_bench/matrix_bench.sh \
  --workloads 50M,500M \
  --regimes good,bad \
  --tiers auth \
  --streams 1,2,4,8 \
  --reps 3

python3 scripts/atp_bench/score_matrix.py \
  artifacts/atp_bench_matrix/<run-id>/results.jsonl \
  --out-md artifacts/atp_bench_matrix/<run-id>/scorecard.md
```

ATP-RQ result rows carry `atp_rq_streams`/`stream_count`, and the scorecard
groups medians and admitted ATP-vs-rsync ratios by stream count. Non-RQ rows,
including tuned rsync, stay single-baseline rows for apples-to-apples scoring.

Fleet etiquette: prefer `hz1` as sender (hz2 is the highest-priority rch build
worker); the responsiveness guard aborts a run series if either machine's
loadavg exceeds 1.5× its core count.

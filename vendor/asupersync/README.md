## TL;DR

**The Problem**: Conventional executor APIs leave important lifecycle contracts
to composition and discipline. Cancellation can abandon partial effects,
detached tasks can outlive their owner, cleanup may be best-effort, and schedule
dependent failures can be difficult to reproduce.

**The Solution**: Asupersync makes its core task-ownership and runtime-tracked
effect contracts **structural rather than conventional**. Tasks are owned by
regions that close to quiescence. Cancellation is an explicit
request → drain → finalize protocol, with budgeted bounds on covered,
cooperative paths; non-cooperative code and foreign calls do not acquire a
universal shutdown bound. Runtime-managed effects require capabilities, with
host-boundary exceptions documented explicitly. The lab runtime makes
controlled schedules deterministic and replayable.

### Why Asupersync?

| Guarantee | What It Means |
|-----------|---------------|
| **No orphan tasks** | Every spawned task is owned by a region; region close waits for all children |
| **Cancel-correctness** | Covered primitives use request → drain → finalize and publish their partial-effect boundaries; this is not a blanket guarantee for arbitrary I/O or adapters |
| **Scoped cleanup bounds** | Budgets are sufficient conditions only where a concrete responsiveness bound is published; non-cooperative work can still delay quiescence indefinitely |
| **No silent drops** | Covered two-phase primitives use reserve/commit so uncommitted work aborts cleanly and committed sends are never half-sent |
| **Deterministic testing** | Lab runtime: virtual time, deterministic scheduling, trace replay |
| **Adaptive preemption fairness** | Deterministic EXP3/Hedge policy tunes cancel streak limits with regret-bounded updates |
| **Drain progress certificates** | Variance-adaptive Azuma/Freedman bounds classify drain phase and confidence to quiescence |
| **Spectral early warnings** | Wait-graph spectral monitor combines conformal bounds and anytime-valid evidence |
| **Capability security** | Runtime effect APIs flow through explicit `Cx` or capability tokens; host-boundary and test-only exceptions stay named and scoped |

---

## Quick Example

Current API note: runtime-wired code spawns through `Cx::spawn` for the current
region, or `Cx::spawn_in` for an explicit scope's region. The remaining
`Scope::spawn_registered` API is the synchronous boot/test path for call sites
that already hold `&mut RuntimeState`.

```rust
use asupersync::{Cx, Error, LabConfig, LabRuntime, Outcome};
use asupersync::runtime::{RuntimeBuilder, SpawnError};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let runtime = RuntimeBuilder::current_thread().build()?;
    let result = runtime.block_on(runtime.handle().spawn(async {
        let cx = Cx::current().expect("runtime task Cx");
        main_task(&cx).await
    }));
    result?;
    Ok(())
}

// Structured concurrency: spawned tasks are owned by the current region and
// joined before the parent task finishes.
async fn main_task(cx: &Cx) -> Result<(), SpawnError> {
    let mut worker_a = cx.spawn(|task_cx| async move { worker_a(&task_cx).await })?;
    let mut worker_b = cx.spawn(|task_cx| async move { worker_b(&task_cx).await })?;

    let a = worker_a.join(cx).await.expect("worker_a joins");
    let b = worker_b.join(cx).await.expect("worker_b joins");
    assert!(matches!(a, Outcome::Ok(())));
    assert!(matches!(b, Outcome::Ok(())));
    Ok(())
}

// Cancellation is a protocol, not a flag.
async fn worker_a(cx: &Cx) -> Outcome<(), Error> {
    cx.checkpoint()?;
    // Do cancel-safe work here, e.g. reserve()/send() on a channel.
    Outcome::ok(())
}

async fn worker_b(cx: &Cx) -> Outcome<(), Error> {
    cx.checkpoint()?;
    Outcome::ok(())
}

// Lab runtime: deterministic testing uses explicit run reports.
#[test]
fn test_cancellation_protocol_invariants() {
    let mut lab = LabRuntime::new(LabConfig::new(42));

    // Enqueue work into `lab.state` / `lab.scheduler`, then drive to quiescence.
    let report = lab.run_until_quiescent_with_report();

    assert!(report.oracle_report.all_passed());
    assert!(report.invariant_violations.is_empty());
}
```

## Coming from tokio?

If you already know tokio, this section maps the primitives you use daily to their asupersync equivalents. The APIs are intentionally different -- asupersync trades implicit convenience for explicit cancel-correctness -- but the concepts map cleanly.

### Concept Mapping

| tokio | asupersync | Key difference |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| `tokio::spawn(fut)` | `cx.spawn(\|cx\| async move { fut.await })` or `cx.spawn_in(&scope, \|cx\| fut)` | Task is owned by a region; cannot orphan. Factory receives its own `Cx`. |
| `JoinHandle<T>` | `TaskHandle<T>` | `.join(&cx).await` returns `Result<T, JoinError>`. JoinError is Cancelled or Panicked. |
| `tokio::spawn_blocking(f)` | `spawn_blocking(f)` | Same idea. Runs closure on a blocking pool thread. |
| `tokio::select!` | `Select::new(a, b).await` | Returns `Either::Left(a)` / `Either::Right(b)`. Futures must be `Unpin`. Use `Scope::race` for auto-drain of losers. |
| `tokio::join!` | `scope.join_all(cx, futs).await` | All branches always complete (no abandonment). Outcomes aggregate via severity lattice. |
| `tokio::time::sleep(dur)` | `sleep(now, dur)` | Takes current `Time` instead of reading the clock implicitly. Works with virtual time in lab runtime. |
| `tokio::time::timeout(dur, fut)` | `timeout(now, dur, fut)` | Returns `Result<T, Elapsed>`. Also see the `Timeout` combinator type for richer outcome handling. |
| `tokio::time::interval(dur)` | `interval(now, dur)` | Same `MissedTickBehavior` options (Burst, Delay, Skip). |
| `tokio::sync::mpsc::channel(n)` | `channel::mpsc::channel::<T>(n)` | Two-phase send: `tx.reserve(&cx).await?.send(val)`. Reserve is cancel-safe; commit cannot fail. |
| `tokio::sync::oneshot::channel()` | `channel::oneshot::channel::<T>()` | Two-phase: `tx.reserve(&cx)` then `permit.send(val)`. |
| `tokio::sync::broadcast::channel(n)` | `channel::broadcast::channel::<T>(n)` | Two-phase send. Lagging receivers get `RecvError::Lagged`. |
| `tokio::sync::watch::channel(init)` | `channel::watch::channel(init)` | `rx.changed(&cx).await?` then `rx.borrow_and_clone()`. |
| `tokio::sync::Mutex` | `sync::Mutex` | `mutex.lock(&cx).await?` -- takes `&Cx`, returns `Result` (can be cancelled). |
| `tokio::sync::RwLock` | `sync::RwLock` | `.read(&cx).await?` / `.write(&cx).await?`. Writer-preference fairness. |
| `tokio::sync::Semaphore` | `sync::Semaphore` | `sem.acquire(&cx, n).await?`. Permit is an obligation released on drop. |
| `tokio::sync::Barrier` | `sync::Barrier` | `barrier.wait(&cx).await?`. Leader election built in (`is_leader`). |
| `tokio::sync::Notify` | `sync::Notify` | `notify.notified().await` / `notify.notify_one()` / `notify.notify_waiters()`. |
| `tokio::sync::OnceCell` | `sync::OnceCell` | `cell.get_or_init(async { ... }).await`. Cancel-safe: failed init lets next caller retry. |
| `tokio::task::yield_now()` | `yield_now()` | Identical concept -- yields to the scheduler. |

### Three things that will surprise you

**1. Every async operation takes `&Cx`.**
Where tokio reads ambient runtime state from thread-locals, asupersync passes an explicit capability context. This means cancellation and budgets compose structurally -- you can see exactly what a function can do from its signature.

```rust
// tokio
let permit = tx.reserve().await?;

// asupersync
let permit = tx.reserve(&cx).await?;
```

**2. No orphan tasks. Scopes close to quiescence.**
In tokio, `tokio::spawn` returns a detached task. In asupersync, every task lives in a region. When a scope exits, it waits for all children to finish. No fire-and-forget, no zombie tasks.

**3. `Outcome` instead of just `Result`.**
Tokio task results are `Result<T, JoinError>` where JoinError covers panics and cancellation. Asupersync uses a four-valued `Outcome<T, E>` that distinguishes `Ok`, `Err`, `Cancelled(reason)`, and `Panicked(payload)`. The severity lattice (`Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked`) drives how combinators aggregate results.

### Quick example: tokio vs asupersync

**tokio:**

```rust
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use tokio::time::{sleep, Duration};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel(10);

    tokio::spawn(async move {
        for i in 0..5 {
            tx.send(i).await.unwrap();
            sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        }
    });

    while let Some(val) = rx.recv().await {
        println!("got: {val}");
    }
}
```

**asupersync:**

```rust
use asupersync::channel::mpsc;
use asupersync::Cx;
use asupersync::time::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

async fn run(cx: &Cx) {
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel::<i32>(10);

    let mut producer = cx.spawn(move |cx| async move {
        for i in 0..5 {
            let permit = tx.reserve(&cx).await.unwrap(); // cancel-safe
            permit.send(i);                               // cannot fail
            sleep(cx.now(), Duration::from_millis(100)).await;
        }
    }).expect("spawn producer");

    while let Ok(val) = rx.recv(&cx).await {
        println!("got: {val}");
    }

    let _ = producer.join(cx).await;
}
```

The key differences: `reserve`/`send` two-phase pattern prevents message loss on cancellation, `&cx` threads through capabilities, and the task is owned by the scope rather than detached.

---

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Structured Concurrency by Construction

Tasks don't float free. Every task is owned by a region. Runtime-spawned tasks
carry that ownership through admission, execution, and teardown. Regions form a
tree. When a region closes, it *guarantees* all children are
complete, all finalizers have run, and all registered obligations are resolved.
This is the "no orphans" invariant, enforced by the public API shape, region
accounting, and runtime/oracle checks rather than by discipline. It is not a
claim that Rust's type system alone proves every adapter or host-boundary path.

```rust
// Typical executors: what happens when this scope exits?
spawn(async { /* orphaned? cancelled? who knows */ });

// Asupersync: scope guarantees quiescence
scope
    .region(
        &mut state,
        &cx,
        asupersync::types::policy::FailFast,
        |sub, state| async move {
            sub.spawn_registered(state, &cx, |task_cx| async move {
                task_cx.checkpoint()?;
                Outcome::ok(())
            })
                .expect("spawn task_a");
            sub.spawn_registered(state, &cx, |task_cx| async move {
                task_cx.checkpoint()?;
                Outcome::ok(())
            })
                .expect("spawn task_b");
            Outcome::ok(())
        },
    )
    .await
    .expect("create child region");
// ← guaranteed: nothing from inside is still running once the child region closes
```

### 2. Cancellation as a First-Class Protocol

Cancellation is request, acknowledgement, drain, and finalization—not a silent
`drop`. It operates as a multi-phase protocol:

```
Running → CancelRequested → Cancelling → Finalizing → Completed(Cancelled)
            ↓                    ↓             ↓
         (bounded)          (cleanup)    (finalizers)
```

- **Request**: propagates down the tree
- **Drain**: tasks run to cleanup points (bounded by budgets)
- **Finalize**: finalizers run (masked, budgeted)
- **Complete**: outcome is `Cancelled(reason)`

Some primitives and proof surfaces publish explicit cancellation responsiveness bounds, such as bounded commit sections, mask-depth limits, scheduler cancel-streak fairness, static plan analysis, and lab cancellation oracles. A blanket per-primitive responsiveness-bound registry is still a design requirement, not a universal runtime guarantee today; budgets are sufficient conditions only for paths with a concrete published bound.

Cancellation progress is continuously certifiable. `ProgressCertificate` tracks potential descent, classifies the current drain regime (`warmup`, `rapid_drain`, `slow_tail`, `stalled`, `quiescent`), and emits variance-adaptive concentration bounds (Freedman with Azuma as a conservative baseline). This turns "is shutdown actually converging?" into a measurable claim instead of a guess.

### 3. Two-Phase Effects Prevent Data Loss

For covered two-phase communication surfaces where cancellation could otherwise lose a message, Asupersync uses reserve/commit:

```rust
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;  // ← cancel-safe: nothing committed yet
permit.send(message);                 // ← linear: must happen or abort
```

Dropping a permit aborts cleanly. Message never partially sent.

This is not a blanket claim for every effect. Inherently partial I/O and adapter surfaces publish their own cancel-safety boundaries, including operations such as `read_exact` and `write_all` that are explicitly not cancel-safe.

### 4. Capability Security (Scoped Authority)

Runtime-managed effects flow through explicit capability tokens:

```rust
async fn my_task(cx: &mut Cx) {
    cx.spawn(...);        // ← need spawn capability
    cx.sleep_until(...);  // ← need time capability
    cx.trace(...);        // ← need trace capability
}
```

Swap `Cx` to change interpretation: production vs. lab vs. distributed.
This is not a blanket claim that every internal helper is `Cx`-threaded:
host-boundary code such as OS entropy for temporary file names, legacy sync DNS
wall-clock timing, and test/support harnesses must keep their authority
explicit, documented, and outside the deterministic runtime guarantee unless
they are reached through a capability-mediated path.

### 5. Deterministic Testing is Default

The lab runtime provides:
- **Virtual time**: sleeps complete instantly, time is controlled
- **Deterministic scheduling**: same seed → same execution
- **Trace capture/replay**: debug production issues locally
- **Schedule exploration**: race-guided deterministic seed exploration with Mazurkiewicz/Foata trace-class deduplication

Concurrency bugs become reproducible test failures.

---

## "Alien Artifact" Quality Algorithms

Asupersync deliberately uses mathematically rigorous machinery where it buys real correctness, determinism, and debuggability. The intent is to make concurrency properties *structural*, so both humans and coding agents can trust the system under cancellation, failures, and schedule perturbations.

### Formal Semantics and Lean-Checked Core Invariants

The runtime design is backed by a small-step operational semantics (`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`) and a Lean project (`formal/lean/Asupersync.lean`) that checks six invariants of that abstract model, recorded in `formal/lean/coverage/invariant_status_inventory.json`: structured concurrency single-owner, region-close quiescence, cancellation protocol, race loser drain, obligation no leaks, and no ambient authority.

The proof posture is exact: these are Lean-checked **model** invariants with theorem and executable-test linkage. The production Rust runtime has not been proved to refine that model. This is therefore not a blanket mechanized proof of the executor, adapters, protocol implementations, platform backends, or distributed transports. Broader runtime-facing claims stay tiered through TLA+/TLC exports, lab/refinement oracles, and lane-specific coverage artifacts. The canonical proof command is `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- lake --dir formal/lean build`; see [`artifacts/formal_proof_posture_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/formal_proof_posture_contract_v1.json), [`tests/formal_proof_posture_contract.rs`](./tests/formal_proof_posture_contract.rs), and [`formal/README.md`](./formal/README.md).

Some checked artifacts retain the legacy markers `Lean-checked core invariants cover the six non-negotiable runtime invariants` and `checks the six non-negotiable runtime invariants`. In this README those phrases mean coverage of the six abstract-model rows only; they do not assert a Rust refinement proof.

The canonical proof-command coverage map is [`artifacts/proof_lane_manifest_v1.json`](./artifacts/proof_lane_manifest_v1.json), checked by [`tests/proof_lane_manifest_contract.rs`](./tests/proof_lane_manifest_contract.rs). It records which `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- ...` lane covers each production graph, feature graph, fuzz smoke, lib/all-target/clippy/rustdoc frontier, and formal proof guarantee, plus what each lane explicitly does not prove. It also carries proof-lane resource-envelope classes for expected timeout, memory, remote-required, and no-local-fallback semantics; those classes harden proof admission metadata and do not replace OS-level RCH worker cgroup limits. The current green/red claim dashboard is [`artifacts/proof_status_snapshot_v1.json`](./artifacts/proof_status_snapshot_v1.json), checked by [`tests/proof_status_snapshot_contract.rs`](./tests/proof_status_snapshot_contract.rs); it maps README/AGENTS proof claims to manifest lanes and validation-frontier blocker rows.

Public guarantee semantic evidence bundles are captured in [`artifacts/public_guarantee_semantic_evidence_bundles_v1.json`](./artifacts/public_guarantee_semantic_evidence_bundles_v1.json), checked by [`tests/semantic_evidence_bundle_contract.rs`](./tests/semantic_evidence_bundle_contract.rs) and documented in [`docs/semantic_evidence_bundle.md`](./docs/semantic_evidence_bundle.md#public-guarantee-bundles). The first bundle set covers `no-orphan-tasks`, `race-loser-drain`, `no-obligation-leaks`, `cancel-safe-send`, `deterministic-replay`, and `default-production-no-tokio`. These bundles map public claims to proof lanes, fixtures, freshness states, and no-claim boundaries; they do not turn `rerun-required`, `stale-evidence`, `blocked`, `no-win`, or `unsupported` rows into fresh proof.

The artifact-governance final signoff is [`artifacts/artifact_governance_final_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/artifact_governance_final_signoff_v1.json), checked by [`tests/artifact_governance_final_signoff_contract.rs`](./tests/artifact_governance_final_signoff_contract.rs) and documented in [`docs/proof/artifact_governance_final_signoff.md`](./docs/proof/artifact_governance_final_signoff.md). Its focused manifest lane is `artifact-governance-final-signoff`; cite it only for the A1-A5/A7/A8 governance aggregation, ledger registration, validation harness count alignment, proof manifest/status rows, README/AGENTS markers, closeout checklist, and no-claim boundaries. It does not prove release readiness, workspace health, runtime correctness, performance improvement, live RCH fleet availability, full-corpus artifact coverage, tracker closure while `.beads` is dirty, or permission to delete files.

The validation-frontier final signoff is [`artifacts/validation_frontier_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/validation_frontier_signoff_v1.json), checked by [`tests/validation_frontier_signoff_contract.rs`](./tests/validation_frontier_signoff_contract.rs) and documented in [`docs/proof/validation_frontier_runbook.md`](./docs/proof/validation_frontier_runbook.md). Its focused manifest lane is `validation-frontier-final-signoff`; cite it only for the VF7 operator packet tying inventory, stale-progress receipts, downstream-consumer proof, graph budgets, the channel MPSC/select fixture split, proof manifest/status rows, e2e runner commands, deterministic Markdown summary, and no-claim boundaries together. It does not prove broad workspace health, release readiness, runtime correctness, performance improvement, no regression, source correctness outside cited surfaces, live RCH fleet availability, local Cargo fallback approval, tracker closure, or permission to delete files.

The Proof Evidence Debt Graph is [`artifacts/proof_evidence_debt_graph_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/proof_evidence_debt_graph_contract_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/proof_evidence_debt_graph.py`](./scripts/proof_evidence_debt_graph.py), checked by [`tests/proof_evidence_debt_graph_contract.rs`](./tests/proof_evidence_debt_graph_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/proof_evidence_debt_graph.md`](./docs/proof_evidence_debt_graph.md). It ranks stale, superseded, blocked, zero-test, local-fallback, missing-envelope, advisory-only, and failed proof evidence so operators can decide what must be rerun before citation. It does not certify workspace health or turn cached/advisory evidence into correctness proof.

<!-- SEMANTIC-EVIDENCE-BUNDLES:README -->

The Semantic Evidence Bundles map is [`artifacts/semantic_evidence_bundles_v1.json`](./artifacts/semantic_evidence_bundles_v1.json), checked by [`tests/semantic_evidence_bundles_contract.rs`](./tests/semantic_evidence_bundles_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/semantic_evidence_bundles.md`](./docs/semantic_evidence_bundles.md). It links public guarantees such as no orphan tasks, loser drain, no obligation leaks, cancel-safe send, deterministic replay, and no default Tokio to manifest-backed proof lanes, stale/missing evidence fixtures, source anchors, freshness policy, and no-claim boundaries. It does not execute the proof lanes or turn cached, stale, failed, local-fallback, or advisory evidence into fresh proof.

The Proof Lane Failure Repro Receipts contract is [`artifacts/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt_contract_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt.py`](./scripts/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt.py), checked by [`tests/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt_contract.rs`](./tests/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt.md`](./docs/proof_lane_failure_repro_receipt.md). It converts saved failed RCH/proof-runner transcripts into minimal repro receipts for compile errors, test assertion failures, timeouts, worker disk pressure, SSH transport failures, retrieval timeouts after remote pass, zero-test proofs, and local-fallback refusals. It chooses the next smallest remote-required rerun or diagnostic command; it does not certify workspace health or turn a repro command into fresh proof.

The Reservation-Aware Fallback Work Finder is [`artifacts/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder_contract_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder.py`](./scripts/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder.py), checked by [`tests/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder_contract.rs`](./tests/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder.md`](./docs/reservation_aware_fallback_work_finder.md). It converts read-only tracker, dirty-tree, and Agent Mail reservation fixture snapshots into safe next-action recommendations for claimable tasks, epic-only ready queues, active reservation blockers, stale in-progress candidates, tracker-only dirt, source peer dirt, no-useful-work blockers, and planning fallbacks. It never authorizes branches/worktrees, peer-reserved edits, or local Cargo fallback, and it does not certify source correctness.

The Second-Wave Swarm Control-Loop Certification bundle is [`artifacts/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_v1.json`](./artifacts/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification.py`](./scripts/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification.py), assembled by [`scripts/run_second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_e2e.sh`](./scripts/run_second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_e2e.sh), checked by [`tests/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_contract.rs`](./tests/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification.md`](./docs/second_wave_swarm_control_loop_certification.md). It aggregates the `asupersync-ol11aa.1` through `asupersync-ol11aa.7` topology, admission, SLO brownout, stale-proof debt, crashpack repro, and fallback work-finder evidence into one operator report. Every child proof command must keep `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --`, isolated `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`, nonzero test evidence, and no-local-fallback semantics. The bundle is not a performance benchmark, not a release publish proof, not a substitute for broad check/clippy/test gates, and not evidence for unrelated source surfaces.

The Third-Wave Swarm Guardrail E2E bundle is [`artifacts/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e_contract_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.py`](./scripts/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.py), assembled by [`scripts/run_third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.sh`](./scripts/run_third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.sh), checked by [`tests/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e_contract.rs`](./tests/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.md`](./docs/third_wave_swarm_guardrail_e2e.md). It invokes child helpers for stale in-progress reaping, br/bv tracker graph drift, reservation lease watchdog coverage, swarm lane closeout, and RCH quiet-phase receipts against checked fixtures. It is not a broad workspace health proof, not a release publish proof, and not a substitute for broad check/clippy/test gates.

The third-wave operator runbook is [`docs/third_wave_swarm_operator_runbook.md`](./docs/third_wave_swarm_operator_runbook.md), checked by [`tests/third_wave_swarm_operator_runbook_contract.rs`](./tests/third_wave_swarm_operator_runbook_contract.rs). It gives the fail-closed signoff checklist for stale work reaping, br/bv drift, reservation renewal, RCH no-local-fallback validation, Agent Mail closeout, peer dirt handling, `main` push, and legacy mirror verification.

The admission-aware proof-lane atlas is anchored by [`artifacts/swarm_proof_lane_planner_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/swarm_proof_lane_planner_contract_v1.json) and checked by [`tests/swarm_proof_lane_planner_contract.rs`](./tests/swarm_proof_lane_planner_contract.rs). Its focused manifest lane is `swarm-proof-lane-planner-contract`, which proves planner fixtures, atlas decision receipts, deterministic JSON/Markdown report goldens, docs markers, manifest mapping, and proof-status claim rows without broad workspace, conformance, throughput, scheduler-performance, or all-target claims.

The migration readiness planner signoff is anchored by [`artifacts/migration_readiness_planner_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/migration_readiness_planner_signoff_v1.json) and checked by the focused `migration-readiness-planner-signoff-contract` lane in [`tests/migration_readiness_planner_contract.rs`](./tests/migration_readiness_planner_contract.rs). Its proof-status claim id is `migration-readiness-planner-signoff`; cite it only for the executable planner inventory, semantic map, operator report, fixture E2E, docs markers, child bead evidence, and validation-command closeout.

The runtime pressure-control evidence contract is [`artifacts/runtime_pressure_control_evidence_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/runtime_pressure_control_evidence_contract_v1.json), checked by [`tests/runtime_pressure_control_evidence_contract.rs`](./tests/runtime_pressure_control_evidence_contract.rs). Its canonical lane is `runtime-pressure-control-evidence-contract` in the proof manifest. The operator handoff is [`docs/runtime_pressure_triage_runbook.md`](./docs/runtime_pressure_triage_runbook.md). That lane proves the pressure snapshot schema versions, region memory-budget pressure row schema, RCH proof-lane pressure row schema, no-local-RCH fallback evidence, operator diagnostics bundle, scheduler pressure flamegraph attribution, deterministic lab scenario families, docs markers, and operator scope limits stay aligned. It does not prove real-host throughput, performance improvement, scheduler regression closure, autonomous scheduler rewrites, production-on-by-default admission/backpressure, per-region allocator enforcement, RCH fleet availability, or a deadlock without explicit trapped-cycle proof. Production pressure signals are advisory unless paired with lab/replay evidence, a committed `artifacts/flamegraphs/main-<bead-or-short-sha>.svg` attribution artifact for triggered scheduler hot-path work, an RCH transcript or admission receipt that rules out local Cargo fallback for remote-required proof lanes, or a trapped-cycle proof, and adaptive controls remain opt-in until stronger evidence supports a wider rollout.

The memory-residency replay e2e contract is [`artifacts/memory_residency_replay_e2e_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/memory_residency_replay_e2e_contract_v1.json), emitted by [`scripts/run_memory_residency_replay_e2e.sh`](./scripts/run_memory_residency_replay_e2e.sh), checked by [`tests/memory_residency_replay_e2e_contract.rs`](./tests/memory_residency_replay_e2e_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/proof/memory_residency_replay_e2e.md`](./docs/proof/memory_residency_replay_e2e.md). Its focused manifest lane is `memory-residency-replay-e2e-contract`; cite it only for the deterministic 64C/256G scenario matrix, e2e runner failure contract, manifest/status mapping, README/AGENTS markers, and no-claim boundaries. It includes no benchmark evidence and does not prove live host throughput, broad workspace health, release readiness, runtime correctness outside the memory-residency policy/accounting surfaces, p50, p95, p999, memory-use, or NUMA performance improvement.

The memory-residency operator safety contract is [`artifacts/memory_residency_operator_safety_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/memory_residency_operator_safety_contract_v1.json), checked by [`tests/memory_residency_operator_safety_contract.rs`](./tests/memory_residency_operator_safety_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/proof/memory_residency_operator_safety.md`](./docs/proof/memory_residency_operator_safety.md). Its focused manifest lane is `memory-residency-operator-safety-contract`; cite it only for enablement prerequisites, fail-closed M1-M4 safety gates, rollback guidance, Agent Mail handoff fields, closeout checklist, README/AGENTS markers, proof manifest/status rows, and no-claim boundaries. It does not prove release readiness, broad workspace health, allocator replacement, performance improvement, live RCH fleet availability, permission to delete files, or local Cargo fallback approval.

The clean-overlay proof orchestration contract is [`artifacts/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_v1.json`](./artifacts/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_v1.json), checked by [`tests/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_contract.rs`](./tests/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_runbook.md`](./docs/clean_overlay_proof_orchestration_runbook.md). Its focused manifest lane is `clean-overlay-proof-orchestration-contract`; cite it only for shared-`main` operator-packet documentation and reference alignment — prerequisites, installed RCH clean-overlay capability evidence and fail-closed command admission, command examples, reservation expectations, RCH heartbeat-fresh/progress-stale cancellation guidance, peer-dirty and capability-drift blocker receipts, non-destructive cleanup/rollback, Agent Mail and `br` comment handoff templates, README/AGENTS markers, proof manifest/status rows, and no-claim boundaries. The referenced planner refuses enforced attempts while unselected peer dirt is present. No overlay command may be emitted unless captured `rch exec --help` evidence declares `--base`, `--clean-overlay`, `--overlay-path`, and `--no-overlay`; unsupported clients and blocked manifests emit only deterministic receipts. The A4 verifier does not prove behavioral correctness of those referenced A1-A3 surfaces; their focused tests are separate evidence. It does not prove release readiness, broad workspace health, performance improvement, live RCH fleet availability, permission to delete files, local Cargo fallback approval, or that peer dirt was excluded without supported installed capability evidence plus an admitted command and terminal execution evidence.

The proof-traffic final signoff is [`artifacts/proof_traffic_final_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/proof_traffic_final_signoff_v1.json), checked by [`tests/proof_traffic_final_signoff_contract.rs`](./tests/proof_traffic_final_signoff_contract.rs), and documented in [`docs/proof_traffic_control.md`](./docs/proof_traffic_control.md). Its focused manifest lane is `proof-traffic-final-signoff`; cite it only for A1-A5 proof-traffic evidence aggregation, the capability-drift gate, admission receipt taxonomy, clean-overlay handshake, proof parking lot, blocked-loop e2e packet, proof manifest/status rows, README/AGENTS markers, no-local-fallback/no-peer-cancel policies, dependency-cycle receipt/checklist, and no-claim boundaries. It does not prove peer-dirt exclusion without supported capability evidence plus an admitted command and terminal execution evidence, release readiness, broad workspace health, runtime correctness, performance improvement, live RCH fleet availability, local Cargo fallback approval, permission to delete files, or permission to cancel peer builds.

The fourth-wave governor proof map is anchored by [`docs/fourth_wave_swarm_governor_runbook.md`](./docs/fourth_wave_swarm_governor_runbook.md) and checked by `fourth-wave-governor-signoff-runbook` in [`tests/fourth_wave_swarm_governor_runbook_contract.rs`](./tests/fourth_wave_swarm_governor_runbook_contract.rs). The final aggregate signoff is [`artifacts/fourth_wave_governor_final_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/fourth_wave_governor_final_signoff_v1.json), checked by `fourth-wave-governor-final-signoff` in [`tests/fourth_wave_governor_final_signoff_contract.rs`](./tests/fourth_wave_governor_final_signoff_contract.rs). The proof-status dashboard separates `fourth-wave-governor-schema-contract`, `fourth-wave-governor-policy-engine`, `fourth-wave-swarm-replay-corpus`, `fourth-wave-runtime-bridge-contract`, and the fourth-wave benchmark no-claim contract. The fourth-wave final aggregated signoff is a scoped executable operator report only: the benchmark contract records no fresh benchmark result and does not prove p95 improvement, throughput improvement, no regression, production-on-by-default control, broad workspace health, or RCH fleet availability.

One example: the cancellation/cleanup **budget** composes as a semiring-like object (componentwise `min`, with priority as `max`), which makes "who constrains whom?" algebraic instead of ad-hoc:

```text
combine(b1, b2) =
  deadline   := min(b1.deadline,   b2.deadline)
  pollQuota  := min(b1.pollQuota,  b2.pollQuota)
  costQuota  := min(b1.costQuota,  b2.costQuota)
  priority   := max(b1.priority,   b2.priority)
```

This is the kind of structure that lets us reason about cancellation protocols and bounded cleanup with proof-friendly, compositional rules.

### Regret-Bounded Adaptive Cancel Preemption (Deterministic EXP3/Hedge)

Scheduler preemption is not fixed to one static cancel streak limit. Workers can run a deterministic EXP3/Hedge-style policy over a bounded set of candidate limits (for example, `{4, 8, 16, 32}`), then update weights at fixed epoch boundaries from observed reward (Lyapunov decrease + fairness + deadline pressure):

```text
p_t(a) = (1 - γ) * w_t(a)/Σ_b w_t(b) + γ/K
w_{t+1}(a) = w_t(a) * exp((γ / K) * r̂_t(a))
```

with importance-weighted reward `r̂_t(a_t) = r_t / p_t(a_t)` for the selected action.

Why it helps: cancel-heavy workloads and latency-heavy workloads need different preemption pressure. This controller adapts online while preserving deterministic replay semantics and bounded starvation envelopes.

### Variance-Adaptive Drain Certificates (Azuma + Freedman + Phase Classification)

Cancellation drain progress is monitored as a martingale-style certificate over potential deltas. The runtime reports both a worst-case Azuma bound and a variance-adaptive Freedman bound:

```text
P(M_t - M_0 ≥ x) ≤ exp(-x² / (2(V_t + c x / 3)))
```

where `V_t` is predictable variation and `c` bounds one-step increments.

The same monitor classifies operational drain regime (`warmup`, `rapid_drain`, `slow_tail`, `stalled`, `quiescent`) so operators can distinguish "normal long tail" from "true stall".

Why it helps: shutdown and fail-fast behavior can be audited with explicit confidence numbers and phase labels, instead of timeout heuristics.

### Spectral Wait-Graph Early Warning (Cheeger/Fiedler + Conformal + E-Process)

Asupersync treats the task wait-for graph as a dynamic signal. The monitor tracks the Fiedler trajectory (algebraic connectivity), spectral gap/radius, and a nonparametric indicator stack (autocorrelation, variance ratio, flicker, skewness, Kendall tau, Spearman rho, Hoeffding's D, distance correlation), then calibrates forward risk with split conformal bounds and an anytime-valid deterioration e-process.

Status: implemented as an observability diagnostic over the live task wait graph. It is an early-warning signal, not a proof of trapped-cycle deadlock by itself.

Why it helps: structural degradation is detected before hard deadlock/disconnect events, with calibrated thresholds and continuously valid evidence rather than brittle one-off alarms.

### DPOR-Style Schedule Exploration (Mazurkiewicz Traces, Foata Fingerprints)

The Lab runtime includes a DPOR-style schedule explorer (`src/lab/explorer.rs`) that treats executions as traces modulo commutation of independent events (Mazurkiewicz equivalence). Instead of a blind seed sweep, it tracks observed equivalence-class fingerprints and uses detected races to prioritize derived deterministic seeds. It does not restore an exact execution prefix and force an alternative enabled transition, so the observed class count is a campaign metric rather than a completeness guarantee.

Result: deterministic, replayable, race-informed schedule fuzzing with explicit
coverage telemetry. It is useful bug-finding machinery, not certified DPOR
coverage of every reachable equivalence class.

### Anytime-Valid Invariant Monitoring via e-processes

Oracles can run repeatedly during an execution without invalidating significance, using **e-processes** (`src/lab/oracle/eprocess.rs`). The key property is Ville's inequality (anytime validity):

```text
P_H0(∃ t : E_t ≥ 1/α) ≤ α
```

So you can "peek" after every scheduling step and still control type-I error, which is exactly what you want in a deterministic scheduler + oracle setting.

### Distribution-Free Conformal Calibration for Lab Metrics

For lab metrics that benefit from calibrated prediction sets, Asupersync uses split conformal calibration (`src/lab/conformal.rs`) with finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees (under exchangeability):

```text
P(Y ∈ C(X)) ≥ 1 − α
```

This is used to keep alerting and invariant diagnostics robust without baking in fragile distributional assumptions.

### Explainable Evidence Ledgers (Bayes Factors, Galaxy-Brain Diagnostics)

When a run violates an invariant (or conspicuously does not), Asupersync can produce a structured evidence ledger (`src/lab/oracle/evidence.rs`) using Bayes factors and log-likelihood contributions. This enables agent-friendly debugging: equations, substitutions, and one-line intuitions, so you can see *exactly why* the system believes "task leak" (or "clean close") is happening.

### Deterministic Algorithms in the Hot Path (Not Just in Tests)

Determinism is treated as a first-class algorithmic constraint across the codebase:

- A deterministic virtual time wheel (`src/lab/virtual_time_wheel.rs`) with explicit tie-breaking.
- Deterministic consistent hashing (`src/distributed/consistent_hash.rs`) for stable assignment without iteration-order landmines.
- Trace canonicalization and race analysis hooks integrated into the lab runtime (`src/lab/runtime.rs`, `src/trace/dpor`).

"Same seed, same behavior" holds end-to-end, not just for a demo scheduler.

## How Asupersync Compares

| Feature | Asupersync | async-std | smol |
|---------|------------|-----------|------|
| **Structured concurrency** | ✅ Enforced | ❌ Manual | ❌ Manual |
| **Cancel-correctness** | ⚠️ Protocol on covered surfaces; adapter boundaries are lane-scoped | ⚠️ Drop-based | ⚠️ Drop-based |
| **No orphan tasks** | ✅ Guaranteed | ❌ spawn detaches | ❌ spawn detaches |
| **Bounded cleanup** | ⚠️ Published cooperative-path bounds only | ❌ Best-effort | ❌ Best-effort |
| **Deterministic testing** | ✅ Built-in | ❌ External tools | ❌ External tools |
| **Obligation tracking** | ✅ Runtime-tracked affine tokens with leak detection | ❌ None | ❌ None |
| **Ecosystem** | ✅ Broad support-class-scoped built-in surface (runtime, net, HTTP/1.1+H2, TLS, WebSocket, gRPC, DB, distributed primitives; adapter lanes stay explicitly bounded) | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Small |
| **Maturity** | ⚠️ Experimental, pre-1.0, actively hardened; broad replacement is not independently established | ✅ Production | ✅ Production |

**When to evaluate Asupersync:**
- Internal or experimental systems that can validate every selected adapter and
  cancellation boundary against their own workload
- Projects that benefit from region ownership, runtime-visible obligations, and
  deterministic schedule reproduction
- Research and migration prototypes comparing structured shutdown behavior
  against established runtimes

**When to consider alternatives:**
- You need strict drop-in compatibility with libraries that are hard-wired to Tokio runtime traits
- Rapid prototyping where correctness guarantees aren't yet critical

## Tokio Ecosystem Coverage Map

Untrusted-root, wrong-hostname, expired-certificate, and unverified-identity paths fail closed; there is no insecure skip-verify default. Native ATP-over-QUIC control frames and the transfer manifest ride the verified handshake-derived 1-RTT STREAM path; direct single-connection RaptorQ symbols ride verified 1-RTT DATAGRAM packets and rely on QUIC AEAD, while non-direct symbol planes retain explicit per-symbol auth.

This map is about capability coverage, not API compatibility. Asupersync intentionally uses a different model centered on `Cx`, regions, explicit cancellation, and deterministic replay.

Web framework status is deliberately bounded. `src/web/` contains a lightweight
router, typed extractors, response conversion, local `Handler` middleware
wrappers, request-region helpers, health/static/multipart/session/security
utilities, and bounded `Sse` / `StreamingSse` surfaces. The SSE lane is
proof-backed: `Sse` finite bounded batch responses, plus a
`StreamingSse` pull API carrying a request-region E2E proof and an
HTTP/1 transport drain proof (`tests/e2e_web.rs` streaming artifact rows).
It is not an
axum/warp/tower-http-compatible framework: handlers operate on Asupersync's
lightweight `Request` / `Response` types, middleware wraps the local `Handler`
trait rather than Tower layers, async handlers use explicit `Cx`-aware wrappers,
and request-region support is not a full server-integrated async request
lifecycle. Treat this as native web primitives on top of the HTTP and service
modules, not framework parity.

Filesystem status is deliberately conservative. `src/fs/` currently exposes
`File`, buffered readers/writers, metadata, directory/path helpers,
`try_exists`, `write_atomic`, `UnixVfs`, and platform capability reports that
ATP consumes through `src/atp/platform/`. Most operations are async facades over
`spawn_blocking_io`; poll-based `File` traits still use direct blocking I/O,
recursive directory removal and large copy operations inherit standard-library
partial-state semantics, and Linux `io_uring` support is limited to
feature-gated helper paths. Treat this as an early blocking-backed filesystem
layer, not comprehensive `tokio::fs` parity or a fully region-native filesystem
driver. The crash-safe ATP disk writer, platform doctor, sparse-write, journal,
resume, and verifier work remains tracked by the ATP-D beads.

The broader host-support policy is captured by the checked
[`Platform Capability Matrix`](./docs/platform_capability_matrix.md), which
keeps supported, feature-gated, partial, unsupported, and not-applicable rows
separate so skipped or unsupported surfaces are never counted as green support
evidence.

If you do need Tokio-locked dependencies at the boundary, use the migration
playbook in [`docs/integration.md`](./docs/integration.md#tokio-migration-playbook).
That guide maps the live `asupersync-tokio-compat` entrypoints to common
stacks: hyper/reqwest/tonic transport, tower/axum middleware, and narrower
Tokio runtime-context or I/O shims. The intended order is native Asupersync
first, compat adapters only where a third-party crate still requires Tokio
traits.

Start brownfield work with the read-only migration readiness planner in
[`docs/integration.md`](./docs/integration.md#migration-readiness-planner):

```bash
python3 scripts/migration_readiness_planner.py --project-root /path/to/rust/project --output-root target/migration-readiness
```

For deterministic examples, list and execute the repo-local fixtures:

```bash
python3 scripts/migration_readiness_planner.py --list
python3 scripts/migration_readiness_planner.py --execute --output-root "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/asupersync_migration_planner_e2e"
```

The report links `summary.final_verdict`, `proof_pack.proof_commands`,
`semantic_map.recommendations`, and `operator_report.phase_plan` back to the
playbook vocabulary before any target project code is edited.

The reactor export contract is narrower than the directory listing suggests: `runtime::reactor` exports `EpollReactor` on Linux, `IoUringReactor` on Linux only (real with `io-uring`, intentional `Unsupported` without it), `KqueueReactor` on BSD-family targets, `IocpReactor` on Windows, `BrowserReactor` on `wasm32`, and `LabReactor` for deterministic testing. Historical files such as `src/runtime/reactor/uring.rs` and `src/runtime/reactor/macos.rs` are not part of the live export graph.

Interest-flag parity is also narrower than the shared `Interest` bitflag type suggests: Linux `EpollReactor` supports the full shipped readiness/mode surface used by the native runtime, `KqueueReactor` rejects `Interest::DISPATCH` and `Interest::PRIORITY`, and `IocpReactor` currently accepts only `READABLE` / `WRITABLE`. Treat Linux `epoll` plus optional `io_uring` as the primary production path, with BSD and Windows reactors available but intentionally narrower today.

## Installation

### From Git (Recommended)

```bash
# Add to Cargo.toml
cargo add asupersync --git https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync

# Or manually add:
# [dependencies]
# asupersync = { git = "https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync" }
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync.git
cd asupersync
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_readme_docs cargo build --release
```

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

Asupersync uses **Rust Edition 2024**. Contributor and release lanes track the
pinned **nightly** toolchain in `rust-toolchain.toml` because the default feature
set includes `nightly-outcome-try` for `Outcome` `Try`/`?` ergonomics.

The audited stable subset is checked with default features disabled and
`proc-macros` enabled:

```bash
bash scripts/run_stable_lane_e2e.sh
```

That runner drives `cargo +stable check`, `clippy`, and the focused `Outcome`
unit tests through RCH with the shared stable-lane target directory. Stable
consumers must use `--no-default-features --features proc-macros` until the
nightly `Outcome` `Try` surface is migrated or disabled by default.

---

## Core Types Reference

### Outcome — Four-Valued Result

```rust
pub enum Outcome<T, E> {
    Ok(T),                    // Success
    Err(E),                   // Application error
    Cancelled(CancelReason),  // External cancellation
    Panicked(PanicPayload),   // Task panicked
}

// Severity lattice: Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked
// HTTP mapping: Ok→200, Err→4xx/5xx, Cancelled→499, Panicked→500
```

### Budget — Resource Constraints

```rust
pub struct Budget {
    pub deadline: Option<Time>,   // Absolute deadline
    pub poll_quota: u32,          // Max poll calls
    pub cost_quota: Option<u64>,  // Abstract cost units
    pub priority: u8,             // Scheduling priority (0-255)
}

// Semiring: meet(a, b) = tighter constraint wins
let effective = outer_budget.meet(inner_budget);
```

### CancelReason — Structured Context

```rust
pub enum CancelKind {
    User,             // Explicit cancellation
    Timeout,          // Deadline exceeded
    FailFast,         // Sibling failed
    RaceLost,         // Lost a race
    ParentCancelled,  // Parent region cancelled
    Shutdown,         // Runtime shutdown
}

// Severity: User < Timeout < FailFast < ParentCancelled < Shutdown
// Cleanup budgets scale inversely with severity
```

### Cx — Capability Context

```rust
pub struct Cx { /* ... */ }

impl Cx {
    pub fn spawn<F, Fut>(&self, f: F) -> Result<TaskHandle<Fut::Output>, SpawnError>;
    pub fn spawn_in<F, Fut, P>(&self, scope: &Scope<'_, P>, f: F)
        -> Result<TaskHandle<Fut::Output>, SpawnError>;
    pub fn checkpoint(&self) -> Result<(), Cancelled>;
    pub fn mask(&self) -> MaskGuard;  // Defer cancellation
    pub fn trace(&self, event: TraceEvent);
    pub fn budget(&self) -> Budget;
    pub fn is_cancel_requested(&self) -> bool;
}
```

### Unsafe Boundaries

The workspace denies unsafe code by default. Required exceptions are tracked in
`artifacts/unsafe_boundary_ledger_v1.json`, with reviewer guidance in
`docs/unsafe_boundary_ledger.md`. The ledger is the canonical unsafe-boundary
inventory for auditors: each row names the source path, category,
category-specific evidence, safety invariant, and explicit no-claim boundary.

The focused `unsafe-boundary-ledger-contract` lane checks that the ledger still
matches live unsafe source locators and that proof manifest/status wiring stays
aligned. Passing that lane does not prove unsafe correctness, execute every
platform-specific FFI path, or replace category evidence; it only proves the
inventory and review-policy metadata are coherent.

### Scheduler Priority Lanes

| Lane | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Cancel Lane** | Tasks in cancellation states | 200-255 (highest) |
| **Timed Lane** | Deadline-driven tasks (EDF) | Based on deadline |
| **Ready Lane** | Normal runnable tasks | Default priority |

Scheduler behavior is intentionally explicit:

- Cancel preemption is bounded, not unbounded. With the default `cancel_streak_limit=16`, ready or timed work gets a dispatch slot within `limit + 1` steps per worker (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- During `DrainObligations` and `DrainRegions`, the effective bound is temporarily widened to `2 * cancel_streak_limit` to finish cleanup without starving everything else (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Workers track fairness telemetry (`fairness_yields`, `max_cancel_streak`) so starvation claims can be checked against runtime counters, not guesses (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Local dispatch uses single-lock multi-lane pops (`try_local_any_lane` and `pop_any_lane_with_hint`) to reduce lock traffic on the hot path while keeping lane ordering rules intact (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- An optional Lyapunov governor can steer lane ordering from periodic runtime snapshots. It is off by default, and when enabled it runs at a configurable interval (`governor_interval`, default `32`) (`src/runtime/config.rs`, `src/runtime/builder.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Adaptive cancel preemption is available as a deterministic no-regret online controller: workers run an EXP3/Hedge-style policy over candidate cancel-streak limits, updating from reward signals that blend Lyapunov decrease, fairness pressure, and deadline pressure (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/runtime/config.rs`, `src/runtime/builder.rs`).
- When governor mode is enabled, scheduling suggestions can be modulated by a decision contract with Bayesian posterior updates over `healthy`, `congested`, `unstable`, and `partitioned` runtime states (`src/runtime/scheduler/decision_contract.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Dispatch follows an explicit multi-phase path: global lanes, fast ready paths, one local-lane lock acquisition, steal attempts, then fallback cancel handling (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Worker wakeups are coordinated through round-robin targeted unparks, with a bitmask fast path when worker count is a power of two (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- I/O polling uses a leader/follower turn: the worker that acquires the I/O driver lock runs the reactor turn while peers continue scheduling (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- Local `!Send` tasks are pinned to owner workers and routed through non-stealable queues; steal paths explicitly reject moving them across workers (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/local_queue.rs`).
- Local queue discipline is asymmetric on purpose: owner operations are LIFO for cache locality, while thief operations are FIFO to keep stolen work older and reduce starvation pressure (`src/runtime/scheduler/local_queue.rs`).
- Idle-worker parking uses a permit-style `Parker` and explicit queue rechecks after wakeups, which closes lost-wakeup races between work injection and parking (`src/runtime/scheduler/worker.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).

### Sharded Runtime State and Lock Discipline

Runtime state is split into independently locked shards so hot-path polling can proceed without serializing every region or obligation mutation.

- Shard A (`tasks`): task table, stored futures, intrusive queue links.
- Shard B (`regions`): region ownership tree and state transitions.
- Shard C (`obligations`): permit/ack/lease lifecycle and leak tracking.
- Shard D (`instrumentation`): trace and metrics surfaces.
- Shard E (`config`): immutable runtime config.

Multi-shard operations use `ShardGuard` with canonical acquisition order `E -> D -> B -> A -> C`, and debug checks enforce that order to prevent deadlocks (`src/runtime/sharded_state.rs`). Shard locks are `ContendedMutex` instances, and optional `lock-metrics` instrumentation can measure wait/hold behavior (`src/sync/contended_mutex.rs`).

### Region Heap Handles and Quiescent Reclamation

Region memory uses stable handles (`HeapIndex`) with slot index, generation, and type tag metadata instead of exposing raw allocation addresses.

- Generation increments on slot reuse, so stale handles fail closed and ABA-style reuse bugs are blocked (`src/runtime/region_heap.rs`).
- Reuse order is deterministic for identical allocation/deallocation sequences, which keeps trace behavior stable across runs (`src/runtime/region_heap.rs`).
- Heap reclamation is wired to region close/quiescence, not opportunistic frees, and stats track live vs. reclaimed objects for runtime auditing (`src/runtime/region_heap.rs`).

### Runtime Control Surfaces: Causal Time, Cancel Attribution, and Deadline Signals

Asupersync exposes runtime controls that are usually hidden behind ad hoc instrumentation. These controls are wired into scheduler and trace behavior directly.

| Control | API | Runtime Behavior |
|---------|-----|------------------|
| Logical clock mode | `RuntimeBuilder::logical_clock_mode(...)` | Select Lamport, Vector, or Hybrid logical clocks for causal ordering; defaults are chosen from runtime context and carried into event timelines (`src/runtime/config.rs`, `src/trace/distributed/vclock.rs`, `src/runtime/state.rs`) |
| Cancel attribution bounds | `RuntimeBuilder::cancel_attribution_config(...)` | Bound cancellation cause-chain depth and memory while preserving root-cause lineage and explicit truncation metadata when limits are hit (`src/types/cancel.rs`, `src/runtime/state.rs`) |
| Deadline monitor | `RuntimeBuilder::deadline_monitoring(...)` | Run a background monitor with configurable check cadence, warning thresholds, adaptive history percentiles, and custom warning callbacks (`src/runtime/deadline_monitor.rs`, `src/runtime/builder.rs`) |

- Deadline checks are logical-time aware and fall back to wall-clock progression when logical time is stable, so stalled-task warnings work in both lab and production-style runs (`src/runtime/deadline_monitor.rs`).
- Warning emission is per-task deduplicated until task removal, so deadline diagnostics stay high-signal under repeated scans (`src/runtime/deadline_monitor.rs`).
- Deadline warnings carry the most recent checkpoint message when available, which makes stalled-task alerts actionable without digging through a full trace first (`src/runtime/deadline_monitor.rs`).

## How We Made It Fast

This runtime got fast through many small, verified runtime changes by the project owner and collaborating coding agents. The method stayed consistent: profile the hot paths, remove one source of contention or allocation at a time, then keep cancellation and determinism guarantees intact.

- **Scheduler lock traffic**: dispatch uses a multi-phase path, and local cancel/timed/ready checks run under one local lock acquisition instead of repeated lock round-trips (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- **Hot-path task isolation**: scheduler queues can run against a dedicated sharded `TaskTable`, so push/pop/steal paths avoid full runtime-state lock pressure (`src/runtime/task_table.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/local_queue.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- **Targeted wake coordination**: worker wakeups go through a coordinator with round-robin unparks and a power-of-two bitmask fast path, so wake selection avoids heavier arithmetic in steady state (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`).
- **Centralized wake dedup**: scheduling paths route through `wake_state.notify()` with an explicit `Idle -> Polling -> Notified` state machine, so wakes that arrive during poll are coalesced once instead of double-enqueueing (`src/record/task.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/worker.rs`).
- **Cheaper wake bookkeeping**: waiter registration paths use `Waker::will_wake` guards to skip redundant clones and refresh only when the executor context actually changes (`src/transport/sink.rs`, `src/transport/mock.rs`).
- **Lost-wakeup hardening without busy spin**: parking uses permit-style semantics, and queue/capacity rechecks close races between waiter registration and wakeups (`src/runtime/scheduler/worker.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/transport/sink.rs`).
- **Allocation pressure reduction**: hot paths moved away from per-dispatch temporary `Vec` usage toward `SmallVec` and pre-sized structures (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/transport/router.rs`, `src/transport/aggregator.rs`).
- **Intrusive queue hot paths**: local ready/cancel queues store links directly in `TaskRecord` with queue-tag membership checks, so owner pop and thief steal stay O(1) without per-operation node allocation (`src/runtime/scheduler/intrusive.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/local_queue.rs`).
- **Lower mutex overhead across the stack**: runtime, scheduler, I/O, lab, networking, and transport internals were migrated to `parking_lot` primitives where it improves lock-path cost (`src/runtime/*`, `src/transport/*`, `src/lab/*`).
- **Atomic and counter-path tuning**: the global injector increments timed counters before heap insert, uses saturating decrements on pop, and keeps a cached earliest-deadline fast path so workers can usually skip timed-lane mutex acquisition (`src/runtime/scheduler/global_injector.rs`).
- **Steal-path locality shortcuts**: local queues track whether any pinned local tasks are present; when none are present, stealers take a no-branch non-local path, and when locals do exist they are skipped/restored with `SmallVec` to keep the common path allocation-free (`src/runtime/scheduler/local_queue.rs`, `src/runtime/scheduler/intrusive.rs`).
- **Backpressure without silent drops**: global ready-queue limits emit capacity warnings while still scheduling work, preserving structured-concurrency guarantees instead of dropping tasks (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/runtime/config.rs`).
- **Reactor fast paths**: I/O registration rearm paths cache waker state, and stale token/fd cleanup is explicit, which keeps event loops moving under churn (`src/runtime/io_driver.rs`, `src/runtime/reactor/*`).
- **Timer wheel tuned for real cancellation workloads**: timer cancel is generation-based O(1), long deadlines spill into overflow and are promoted back in range, and coalescing windows can batch nearby wakeups with minimum-group gating (`src/time/wheel.rs`, `src/time/driver.rs`).
- **Panic containment on worker threads**: task polling is guarded so panics are converted into terminal `Outcome::Panicked`, dependents/finalizers are still driven, and one bad task does not take down a worker lane (`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs`, `src/runtime/builder.rs`).
- **Timer behavior measured where it matters**: the timer benchmark corpus includes direct wheel-vs-`BTreeMap`/`BinaryHeap` comparisons; the documented 10K corpus (release-perf profile, 2026-06-01) records a ~27x cancel-path advantage over `BTreeMap`, and the wheel now also wins the mixed insert/cancel/expire workload outright (`benches/timer_wheel.rs`).
- **Stable memory handles with deterministic reuse**: region-heap generation indices prevent ABA-style stale-handle reuse while preserving deterministic allocation/reuse patterns (`src/runtime/region_heap.rs`).
- **Continuous measurement**: the repository carries dedicated benchmark surfaces for scheduler, reactor, timer wheel, cancel/drain, and tracing overhead (`benches/scheduler_benchmark.rs`, `benches/reactor_benchmark.rs`, `benches/timer_wheel.rs`, `benches/cancel_drain_bench.rs`, `benches/tracing_overhead.rs`).

## Networking & Protocol Stack

Asupersync ships a structured networking stack from raw sockets through application protocols. Runtime-owned endpoints participate in structured concurrency, readiness/registration cleanup is explicit, and the lab runtime can substitute virtual TCP for deterministic network testing. Cancel-safety is operation-specific: atomic datagram sends and covered two-phase/adapter surfaces state their guarantees, while partial byte-stream reads and writes such as `read_exact` and `write_all` retain their documented cancellation boundaries.

Reactor and I/O paths are also hardened for long-lived production behavior:

- Registrations are RAII-backed and deregistration treats `NotFound` as already-cleaned state, so cancellation/drop races do not leak bookkeeping (`src/runtime/io_driver.rs`, `src/runtime/reactor/registration.rs`).
- Token slabs are generation-tagged, which blocks stale-token wakeups after slot reuse (`src/runtime/reactor/token.rs`).
- The I/O driver records `unknown_tokens` instead of panicking when stale/backend events appear, so diagnostics stay available under fault conditions (`src/runtime/io_driver.rs`).
- `epoll` interest mapping supports edge-triggered and edge-oneshot modes plus explicit PRIORITY/HUP/ERROR propagation, so readiness semantics are carried with fewer implicit assumptions (`src/runtime/reactor/epoll.rs`).
- `epoll` paths explicitly clean stale fd/token mappings on `ENOENT`/closed-fd conditions, including fd-reuse edge cases (`src/runtime/reactor/epoll.rs`).
- `io_uring` poll handles timeout expiry (`ETIME`) as a timeout condition, not an operational failure, and ignores stale completions for deregistered tokens (`src/runtime/reactor/io_uring.rs`).

### TCP

`src/net/tcp/` provides `TcpStream`, `TcpListener`, and split reader/writer halves. Connections are registered with the I/O reactor (epoll or io_uring) and use oneshot waker semantics: the reactor disarms interest after each readiness event, and the stream re-arms explicitly. This avoids spurious wakes at the cost of a `set_interest` call per poll cycle, which benchmarks show is negligible compared to syscall overhead.

A `VirtualTcp` implementation (`src/net/tcp/virtual_tcp.rs`) provides a fully in-memory TCP abstraction for lab-runtime tests. Same API surface, deterministic behavior, no kernel sockets.

### HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2

`src/http/h1/` implements HTTP/1.1 with chunked transfer encoding, connection keep-alive, and streaming request/response bodies. `src/http/h2/` implements HTTP/2 frame parsing, HPACK header compression, flow control, and stream multiplexing over a single connection.

Both layers integrate with connection pooling (`src/http/pool.rs`) and optional response compression (`src/http/compress.rs`).

### WebSocket

`src/net/websocket/` ships handshake, binary/text frames, ping/pong, and close
frames with status codes. The split reader/writer model allows concurrent send
and receive within the same region. Current `tests/conformance` wiring keeps
both the extension-negotiation suite and the broader directory-backed RFC 6455
suite live, covering framing, masking, control-frame, close, error-handling, and
fragmentation harnesses against the production WebSocket parser and handshake
surfaces. Runtime cancellation and integration behavior remain covered by the
focused `tests/e2e_websocket.rs` and `tests/e2e/websocket/` lanes rather than by
the byte-level RFC harness alone.

### TLS

`src/tls/` wraps `rustls` for TLS 1.2/1.3 with three feature flags:

| Flag | Root Certs |
|------|------------|
| `tls` | Bring your own |
| `tls-native-roots` | OS trust store |
| `tls-webpki-roots` | Mozilla's WebPKI bundle |

The `tls` feature selects rustls' ring provider so TLS works out of the box
instead of requiring each application to install a process-global
`CryptoProvider`. Asupersync's own certificate-pin SHA-256 helpers use the
existing pure-Rust `sha2` dependency, but ring remains the native crypto backend
for rustls. Cross-compiling TLS to `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` from a Unix worker
therefore requires the MinGW C toolchain (`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`) even though
the asupersync source is Windows-gated.

### DNS and UDP

`src/net/dns/` provides async DNS resolution with address-family selection. `src/net/udp.rs` provides async UDP sockets with send/receive and cancellation safety.

### Transport Routing and Multipath Delivery

`src/transport/` covers runtime-level delivery behavior above raw sockets and below protocol clients:

- `router.rs` tracks endpoint health and routing state with atomics (`EndpointState`, connection counters, failure counters) and uses RAII guards for active connection/dispatch accounting, including cancel/panic paths.
- `aggregator.rs` handles multipath symbol intake with dedup windows, reorder handling, and per-path statistics for loss/duplicate tracking.
- `sink.rs` and `stream.rs` use queued waiters with atomic flags and explicit wakeup bookkeeping to avoid lost-wakeup edge cases in bounded channel transport.
- `sink.rs` deduplicates waiter updates with `Waker::will_wake` checks and re-checks capacity after waiter registration, which closes the capacity-check/registration lost-wakeup race (`src/transport/sink.rs`).
- Shared channel close paths wake both send and receive waiters, so shutdown does not strand pending channel operations (`src/transport/mod.rs`).

---

## Database Integration

Asupersync includes async clients for three databases, each respecting structured concurrency and cancellation.

| Database | Location | Wire Protocol | Auth |
|----------|----------|---------------|------|
| **SQLite** | `src/database/sqlite.rs` | Blocking pool bridge | N/A |
| **PostgreSQL** | `src/database/postgres.rs` | Binary protocol v3 | SCRAM-SHA-256 |
| **MySQL** | `src/database/mysql.rs` | MySQL wire protocol | Native + caching_sha2 |

All three support prepared statements, transactions, and connection reuse. SQLite operations run on the blocking thread pool (since `rusqlite` is synchronous) with cancel-safe wrappers that respect region deadlines. PostgreSQL and MySQL implement their wire protocols directly over `TcpStream`, avoiding external driver dependencies.

The `sqlite` feature uses `rusqlite` with bundled SQLite for predictable local
behavior. Native Windows builds work with the normal platform C toolchain;
cross-compiling to `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` also needs MinGW available because
`libsqlite3-sys` compiles the bundled SQLite C source.

### Blocking Pool Safety Semantics

`src/runtime/blocking_pool.rs` enforces several invariants that matter under cancellation and panic-heavy workloads:

- Thread expansion only happens when pending work exists and all active workers are busy.
- Idle retirement uses an atomic claim step that cannot retire below `min_threads`.
- Panicking blocking tasks are wrapped so completion signaling and busy-thread counters are still balanced.
- Failed thread spawns roll back active-thread accounting immediately.

---

## Remote Runtime and Distributed Coordination

Asupersync's distributed runtime surface is designed around the same
invariants as local execution: explicit ownership, explicit cancellation, and
deterministic state transitions. Today the core crate ships the remote
protocol/state-machine surface plus capability, lease, idempotency, and saga
contracts. The shipped proof tier now includes both the deterministic
virtual/lab baseline and a production-transport-backed loopback proof through
`asupersync::net::TcpListener` / `TcpStream`. Broader deployment concerns such
as discovery, TLS/authentication, WAN retry policy, and a frozen production wire
format remain adapter-specific rather than blanket core-runtime claims.

| Primitive | Location | Runtime Behavior |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| Named remote spawn | `src/remote.rs` | `spawn_remote` creates a region-owned `RemoteHandle`; attached runtimes send protocol messages, while missing runtimes fail closed to an explicit deterministic fallback |
| Lease obligations | `src/remote.rs` | Leases are obligation-backed and participate in region close/quiescence |
| Idempotency store | `src/remote.rs` | Deduplicates spawn retries with TTL-bounded records and conflict detection |
| Session-typed protocol | `src/remote.rs` | Origin/remote state machines validate legal spawn/ack/cancel/result/renewal transitions |
| Logical-time envelopes | `src/remote.rs` | Protocol messages carry logical clock metadata for causal correlation |
| Saga compensations | `src/remote.rs` | Forward steps and compensations are tracked as a structured rollback flow for distributed workflows |

The transport surface is deliberately separated from protocol state machines,
so message semantics can be tested independently of network backend details.
`tests/remote_transport_lifecycle_contract.rs` proves that a TCP-backed
`RemoteRuntime` adapter preserves spawn/result, cancellation before ack,
cancellation while running, lease renewal, lease expiry, idempotency replay,
send failure, receive EOF, malformed envelope cleanup, delayed ack ordering,
capability denial, and deterministic no-runtime fallback behavior.

## Channels and Synchronization Primitives

### Channels

| Channel | Location | Pattern | Cancel-Safe |
|---------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **MPSC** | `src/channel/mpsc.rs` | Multi-producer, single-consumer | Two-phase send (reserve/commit) |
| **Oneshot** | `src/channel/oneshot.rs` | Single send, single receive | Two-phase send |
| **Broadcast** | `src/channel/broadcast.rs` | Fan-out to subscribers | Waiter cleanup on drop |
| **Watch** | `src/channel/watch.rs` | Last-value multicast | Always-current read |
| **Session** | `src/channel/session.rs` | Typed RPC with reply obligation | Reply is a linear resource |

The two-phase pattern (reserve a permit, then commit the send) is central to cancel-correctness. A reserved-but-uncommitted permit aborts cleanly on cancellation. A committed send is guaranteed delivered. No half-sent messages.

### Synchronization

| Primitive | Location | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Mutex** | `src/sync/mutex.rs` | Fair, cancel-safe, tracks contention |
| **RwLock** | `src/sync/rwlock.rs` | Writer preference with reader batching |
| **Semaphore** | `src/sync/semaphore.rs` | Counting, with permit-as-obligation model |
| **Barrier** | `src/sync/barrier.rs` | N-way synchronization point |
| **Notify** | `src/sync/notify.rs` | One-time or multi-waiter notification |
| **OnceLock** | `src/sync/once_cell.rs` | Async one-time initialization |
| **ContendedMutex** | `src/sync/contended_mutex.rs` | Mutex with contention metrics |
| **Pool** | `src/sync/pool.rs` | Object pool with per-thread caches |

The synchronization primitives are deterministic under the lab runtime and
their wait queues/guards have focused cancellation and cleanup coverage.
Futurelock detection is narrower: it fires for tasks that stop being polled
while holding runtime-recorded obligations, such as channel permits, leases,
`IoOp` records, and semaphore permit tokens. Mutex and RwLock guards release
on drop and are covered by guard/queue cleanup tests, but they are not
themselves futurelock-tracked obligations unless the surrounding task also
holds a runtime obligation.

## Concurrency Combinators

Beyond `join`, `race`, and `timeout`, the combinator library includes patterns for distributed systems and resilience:

| Combinator | Location | Purpose |
|------------|----------|---------|
| **quorum** | `src/combinator/quorum.rs` | M-of-N completion for consensus patterns |
| **hedge** | `src/combinator/hedge.rs` | Start backup after delay, first response wins |
| **first_ok** | `src/combinator/first_ok.rs` | Try operations sequentially until one succeeds |
| **pipeline** | `src/combinator/pipeline.rs` | Staged transformations with backpressure |
| **map_reduce** | `src/combinator/map_reduce.rs` | Parallel map + monoid reduction |
| **circuit_breaker** | `src/combinator/circuit_breaker.rs` | Failure detection, open/half-open/closed states |
| **bulkhead** | `src/combinator/bulkhead.rs` | Concurrency isolation (bounded parallelism) |
| **rate_limit** | `src/combinator/rate_limit.rs` | Token bucket throughput control |
| **bracket** | `src/combinator/bracket.rs` | Acquire/use/release with guaranteed cleanup |
| **retry** | `src/combinator/retry.rs` | Exponential backoff, budget-aware |

The core combinators publish cancel-safety contracts, and race/select-style winners drain losers through dedicated drain paths. Outcomes aggregate via the severity lattice. An explicit law sheet (`src/combinator/laws.rs`) documents algebraic properties (associativity, commutativity, distributivity), while the rewrite engine (`src/plan/rewrite.rs`) optimizes only through explicit `RewritePolicy` gates and conservative `src/plan/analysis.rs` side-condition checks. `Unknown`, `MayLeak`, or `MayOrphan` analysis results are not proof that a rewrite preserves cancel/drain/quiescence invariants.

---

## RaptorQ Fountain Coding

`src/raptorq/` implements RFC 6330 systematic RaptorQ codes, a fountain code where any K-of-N encoded symbols suffice to recover the original K source symbols. This underpins Asupersync's distributed snapshot distribution: region state is encoded, symbols are assigned to replicas via consistent hashing, and recovery requires collecting a quorum of symbols from surviving nodes.

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `rfc6330.rs` | Standard-compliant parameter computation |
| `systematic.rs` | Systematic encoder/decoder |
| `gf256.rs` | GF(2^8) arithmetic (addition, multiplication, inversion) |
| `linalg.rs` | Matrix operations over GF(256) |
| `pipeline.rs` | Full sender/receiver pipelines with symbol authentication (`verify_auth`; fail-closed). The production `transport_rq` transport now forces a *deliberate* posture choice — see `asupersync-e880xo` |
| `proof.rs` | Decode proof system for verifiable recovery |

The implementation is deterministic (no randomness in lab mode) and can integrate with the security layer (`src/security/`) for per-symbol authentication tags (fail-closed when `verify_auth` is enabled — forged/contextless symbols are rejected). **REALITY (`asupersync-e880xo`): the production ATP RaptorQ transport (`src/net/atp/transport_rq`) is now fail-closed on symbol-auth posture: a default `RqConfig` is `MissingAuthenticationContext`, so `send_path`/`receive_once` refuse to run (before any network I/O) unless the caller makes a deliberate choice — `with_symbol_auth(ctx)` (every UDP symbol is signed and verified) or the explicit `allow_unauthenticated_for_trusted_transport()` opt-out (integrity-vs-manifest only). The handshake additionally rejects any posture mismatch between peers in both directions. NO-CLAIM BOUNDARY: authenticated mode protects the UDP symbol plane only; the TCP control channel + manifest are still unauthenticated, and the sibling `transport_tcp` transport has no per-symbol authentication at all (integrity-vs-manifest only). Full Byzantine-injection prevention against an active MITM therefore requires `with_symbol_auth` AND an authenticated control channel/manifest (e.g. TLS) — otherwise a MITM can substitute a matching forged manifest + symbols. Pinned end-to-end by `tests/atp_rq_symbol_auth_e2e_contract.rs` (transport truth) and `tests/decoding_secure_default.rs` (config posture).**

On the decode side, the runtime uses a policy-driven deterministic planner instead of a single fixed elimination strategy:

- Runtime policy selection can choose conservative baseline, high-support-first, or block-Schur low-rank hard-regime plans based on extracted matrix features (`src/raptorq/decoder.rs`).
- Hard-regime transitions and conservative fallbacks are recorded with explicit reason labels for replay/debug analysis (`src/raptorq/decoder.rs`, `src/raptorq/proof.rs`, `src/raptorq/test_log_schema.rs`).
- Dense-factor artifacts are cached with bounded capacity and explicit hit/miss/eviction telemetry in decode stats (`src/raptorq/decoder.rs`).
- GF(256) kernels are selected deterministically per process, with policy snapshots for dual-lane fused operations and optional SIMD acceleration behind `simd-intrinsics` (`src/raptorq/gf256.rs`).

### One-Command RaptorQ Validation

Use the deterministic E2E wrapper with `--bundle` to run staged unit/perf-smoke gates plus scenario coverage with a single command:

```bash
# Fast smoke (unit sentinel + perf smoke + fast scenario profile)
NO_PREFLIGHT=1 ./scripts/run_raptorq_e2e.sh --profile fast --bundle

# Full profile
NO_PREFLIGHT=1 ./scripts/run_raptorq_e2e.sh --profile full --bundle

# Forensics profile (includes additional repair_campaign perf smoke)
NO_PREFLIGHT=1 ./scripts/run_raptorq_e2e.sh --profile forensics --bundle
```

Operational notes:
- The wrapper auto-uses `rch` when available for Cargo test, benchmark, and scenario-test stages.
- `--profile` supports `fast|full|forensics`; `--scenario <ID>` can target one deterministic scenario.
- Artifact outputs include `summary.json`, `scenarios.ndjson`, and (when bundled) `validation_stages.ndjson`.
- Increase `VALIDATION_TIMEOUT` or `E2E_TIMEOUT` if your environment is slower than expected.

### Multi-Donor Bonded Transfers (`atp bond-pull`)

RaptorQ's fountain property — any K-of-N symbols recover the K source symbols — makes it natural to pull a single object from **many donors at once**. In a *bonded* transfer, one receiver enrolls N donors; each donor is assigned a disjoint slice of the symbol stream (source + repair ESIs) and sprays it over UDP, and the receiver decodes from the *union*. The aggregate goodput is the sum of the donors' upload paths, and because symbols are order-independent, a donor that dies mid-transfer costs nothing but its remaining repair window, which is reallocated to the survivors (`src/net/atp/bonding/`, `src/net/atp/transport_rq/bonded.rs`).

**Content agreement is fail-closed and the descriptor is never on the wire.** The receiver and every donor independently derive the bonded descriptor (transfer-id, merkle root, per-entry object IDs, portable metadata commitment) from *their own local bytes* via the same derivation; enrollment rejects on any transfer-id / merkle-root / metadata / symbol-size / max-block-size mismatch (`src/net/atp/bonding/derive.rs`, enrollment checks in `transport_rq/bonded.rs`). A donor whose bytes have drifted cannot enroll, so it cannot corrupt the decode. Per-symbol authentication posture (RaptorQ symbol-auth key, or the explicit unauthenticated-lab opt-out) is the same deliberate, fail-closed choice as the single-source RaptorQ transport above.

The receiver-orchestrated CLI is one command:

```bash
# Receiver pulls /srv/payload from two donors, advertising its control endpoint.
atp bond-pull /srv/payload /dest --donors alice@h1,bob@h2 \
  --advertise 203.0.113.7:8473 --rq-auth-key-hex "$KEY"
```

`bond-pull` starts the in-process bonded receiver, SSH-launches one `bond-donate` leg per donor host, and waits for the fail-closed commit — SHA/merkle-verified before anything lands in `/dest`.

**Per-donor transport selection** (`--transport auto|tailscale|ssh|ip`): each donor's tailnet membership is probed over ssh, then a dial path is chosen per donor (`src/net/atp/bonding/transport_select.rs`). `auto` prefers a shared Tailscale path (CGNAT `100.64.0.0/10`) when both ends are on the tailnet, else a direct IP; `ip`/`tailscale` force a family; `ssh` tunnels the symbol stream. (The live `ssh -L` forward is the remaining real-multi-host step, tracked under `z01bbr.8.3`; today an ssh-selected leg reports its tunnel plan and falls back to a direct dial.) The chosen path per donor is recorded in the `atp_bond_pull` JSON receipt so a run is auditable after the fact.

**Programmatic use** — the `BondedTransfer` SDK builder drives a real bonded transfer over the same data path, cancel-correctly:

```rust
use asupersync::net::atp::sdk::BondedTransfer;

// Blocking receive with a final report:
let report = BondedTransfer::receive(dest, local_src)
    .expect_donors(2)
    .listen("0.0.0.0:8473".parse()?)
    .auth_key_hex(key_hex)
    .run(&cx);

// Or spawn as an owned child and stream live progress:
let handle = BondedTransfer::receive(dest, local_src)
    .expect_donors(2)
    .spawn(&cx)?;
let addr = handle.control_addr();            // bound control endpoint for donors
while let Some(p) = handle.next_progress() { // per-donor ingress, blocks remaining, feedback rounds
    println!("{:.0}% ({}/{} blocks)", p.progress_percent(), p.blocks_total - p.blocks_remaining, p.blocks_total);
}
let outcome = handle.wait_for_completion();  // AtpOutcome: Ok / Err / Cancelled / Panicked
```

`spawn` runs the receiver as an owned child of the `Cx`'s region; `handle.cancel()` aborts it and the child unwinds to quiescence committing nothing (a final `cx.checkpoint()` guards even the last instant before the irreversible commit). The progress stream emits a terminal `Completed` on success or `Failed` on a verification failure; cancellation and other terminal errors are observed as the stream closes plus the join outcome.

---

## Stream Combinators

`src/stream/` provides a composable stream library with the standard functional operators: `map`, `filter`, `take`, `skip`, `chunks`, `chain`, `merge`, `zip`, `fold`, `for_each`, `inspect`, `enumerate`, `any_all`, `count`, `fuse`, `buffered`, and `try_stream`. Streams integrate with channels (`broadcast_stream`, `receiver_stream`) and participate in cancellation; a dropped stream cleanly aborts any pending I/O.

## Lab Runtime Failure Forensics

The lab runtime includes dedicated failure detectors and recovery artifacts, so concurrency failures carry structured evidence instead of vague timeouts.

- Futurelock detection tracks tasks that still hold pending obligations but stop being polled for longer than `futurelock_max_idle_steps`. Detection emits `TraceEventKind::FuturelockDetected` with task, region, and held-obligation details, and can optionally panic immediately (`panic_on_futurelock`) (`src/lab/runtime.rs`, `src/lab/config.rs`).
- Restorable snapshots include deterministic content hashes over full serialized runtime state (`verify_integrity()`), plus structural validation (`validate()`) that checks reference validity, region-tree acyclicity, closed-region quiescence, and timestamp consistency before restore (`src/lab/snapshot_restore.rs`).
- Chaos mode is deterministic and seed-bound: pre-poll and post-poll injection points can apply cancellation, delay, budget exhaustion, and wakeup storms while emitting trace events and cumulative injection stats (`src/lab/chaos.rs`, `src/lab/config.rs`, `src/lab/runtime.rs`).
- Failing lab runs can auto-attach deterministic crashpack linkage (stable id/path/fingerprint plus replay command metadata), and manual crashpack attachments are preserved without duplicate auto-insertions (`src/lab/runtime.rs`, `src/trace/crashpack.rs`).

---

## Observability

### Structured Logging

`src/observability/entry.rs` defines `LogEntry` with span IDs, task IDs, region context, and structured fields. Log levels (Trace through Error) are separate from cancellation severity. The `LogCollector` batches entries for export.

### Metrics

`src/observability/metrics.rs` provides Counter, Gauge, and Histogram abstractions with a zero-allocation hot path. Optional OpenTelemetry integration (`src/observability/otel.rs`) exports to any OTLP-compatible backend. Multiple exporters (stdout, in-memory for tests, null for benchmarks) can compose via `MultiExporter`.

### Task Inspector and Diagnostics

`src/observability/task_inspector.rs` introspects live task state: obligation holdings, poll counts, wait dependencies, and cancellation status. `src/observability/diagnostics.rs` produces structured explanations: `CancellationExplanation` traces the full cancel propagation chain, `TaskBlockedExplanation` identifies what a task is waiting on, and `ObligationLeak` pinpoints which obligation was not resolved and by whom.

For structural runtime risk, diagnostics also maintain a spectral health monitor over the live task wait graph (`src/observability/spectral_health.rs`, `src/observability/diagnostics.rs`). It tracks the Fiedler trend and classifies early-warning severity (`none/watch/warning/critical`) using a multi-signal ensemble: autocorrelation (critical slowing), variance growth, flicker, skewness, Kendall tau, Spearman rho, Hoeffding's D, distance correlation, split-conformal lower bounds, and an anytime-valid deterioration e-process.

---

## Proc Macros

`asupersync-macros/` provides proc macros for ergonomic structured concurrency:

```rust
use asupersync::{join, race, scope, spawn, Cx};
use asupersync::runtime::RuntimeState;

async fn macro_example(cx: &Cx, state: &mut RuntimeState) {
    scope!(cx, state: state, {
        let a = spawn!(async { worker_a().await });
        let b = spawn!(async { worker_b().await });
        join!(a, b)
    });

    let winner = race!(cx, {
        task_a(),
        task_b(),
    });
    let _ = winner;
}
```

These macros are available in the default feature set. The default production
feature set is intentionally limited to `proc-macros` plus
`nightly-outcome-try`; test-only internals are opt-in. If you opt out of
default features for a minimal core-only build, re-enable `proc-macros`
explicitly.

Current contract:

- Supported root macros in `proc-macros` builds are `scope!`, `spawn!`, `join!`, `join_all!`, and `race!`.
- `scope!` binds a `Scope` for the current region; it does not create a fresh child-region boundary. Use `Scope::region(...)` when you need quiescence on scope exit.
- `spawn!` requires runtime state (`state: &mut RuntimeState` or ambient `__state`) in addition to `Cx`.
- `join!` and `join_all!` are supported today, but they still await branches sequentially.
- `race!` expands to `Cx::race*`; losers are cancelled by drop, not drained. Use `Scope::race` when loser-drain semantics matter.
- Minimal builds without `proc-macros` do not have a usable macro DSL fallback: `join!` and `race!` intentionally fail with `compile_error!`, while `scope!`, `spawn!`, and `join_all!` are unavailable until `proc-macros` is re-enabled.

Compile-fail tests (via `trybuild`) verify that incorrect usage produces clear
error messages. See `docs/macro-dsl.md` for the full pattern catalog.

---

## Conformance Suite

Current reality: the Cargo-compiled conformance registry for this repository is
the integration-test entrypoint at `tests/conformance.rs`, which includes the
live module list from `tests/conformance/mod.rs`. Do not copy the registry
counts into prose: the checked source of truth is
`artifacts/conformance_registry_contract_v1.json`, and
`tests/conformance_registry_contract.rs` verifies that its active and dormant
module lists still match `tests/conformance/mod.rs`. Some active entries or
result lanes are gated by `mysql`, `quic`, `tls`, or platform-specific cfgs.

The active registry covers:

- **Channel, codec, and capability semantics**: channel cleanup, framing properties, round trips, and `Cx` capability contracts
- **HTTP and compression surfaces**: active HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, HPACK, request-target/protocol, and HTTP/3 control-stream / DATAGRAM / Extended CONNECT suites built against current APIs
- **gRPC and transport protocol checks**: max-message framing, max-message-size, status mapping, trailer forwarding, gRPC-Web framing, TCP accept/listener, and timeout harnesses
- **Security and wire-level protocol lanes**: TLS handshake / key-share / SNI / 0-RTT replay (including HelloRetryRequest coverage), QUIC retry (plus QUIC migration when enabled), DNS message parsing, Kafka offsets / record batches, and explicit MySQL AuthSwitch plus PostgreSQL extended-query / COPY / logical-replication coverage
- **Deterministic invariant suites**: cancel DAG determinism, obligation lifecycle, race loser-drain, trace replay idempotency, broadcast, and consistent-hash regression coverage

Important limitation: the repository also preserves many conformance files on
disk that are **not** part of the live registry today. `tests/conformance/mod.rs`
leaves explicit commented-out `pub mod` entries as known bit-rot,
superseded-suite, or unresolved-dependency follow-ups, including older `h1_*`
siblings, `sqlite_prepared_statements`, `grpc_deadline`, `grpc_health`,
`grpc_status`, `h3_settings`, `quic_initial`, and `task_inspector_wire`.
The contract artifact records each dormant suite's
current disposition, owner bead or supersession path, and retention reason.
Those files remain in-tree for repair work, but they do not compile or run
until they are re-wired in `tests/conformance/mod.rs`.

The separate `conformance/` workspace member still exists for standalone
vendor/spec harnesses, but it should not be read as proof that every
disk-resident file under `tests/conformance/` is active in CI.

Volatile project facts such as LOC totals, workspace-member counts, conformance
registry counts, and roadmap status are audited in
[`provider_audit_log.md`](./provider_audit_log.md). Treat live command output
and checked contract artifacts as the source of truth for those values.

Related test and CI entrypoints include:

- `scripts/run_all_e2e.sh` (orchestrated suite execution and summary checks)
- `scripts/run_raptorq_e2e.sh` (RaptorQ deterministic scenarios)
- `scripts/run_phase6_e2e.sh` (phase-6 integration surface)
- `scripts/check_no_mock_policy.py` (no-mock/fake/stub policy gate)
- `scripts/check_coverage_ratchet.py` (coverage regression ratchet)
- `scripts/check_wasm_flake_governance.py` (WASM flake/quarantine/forensics release gate)

These scripts are broader repository gates, not a substitute for the live
`tests/conformance/mod.rs` registry when you need the exact wired-vs-dormant
coverage picture.

Tests emit deterministic artifact bundles (`event_log.txt`,
`failed_assertions.json`, `repro_manifest.json`) when
`ASUPERSYNC_TEST_ARTIFACTS_DIR` is set, and the E2E runners emit JSON summaries
for replay automation.

## Spork (OTP Mental Model)

Spork is an OTP-style layer built on Asupersync's kernel guarantees: regions
(structured concurrency), obligations (linearity), explicit cancellation, and the
deterministic lab runtime.

### OTP Mapping (Conceptual)

| OTP Concept | Spork / Asupersync Interpretation |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| Process | A region-owned task/actor (cannot orphan) |
| Supervisor | A compiled, deterministic restart *topology* over regions — boot ordering + restart-plan computation; tree-level live restart-on-failure is pending (`asupersync-8y37kz.2`), so today live restart is per-actor (`src/actor.rs`) |
| Link | Failure propagation rule (sibling/parent coupling; deterministic) |
| Monitor + DOWN | Observation without coupling: deterministic notifications |
| Registry | Names as lease obligations: reserve/commit or abort (no stale names) |
| call/cast | Request/response and mailbox protocols with bounded drain on cancel |

### Why Spork Is Strictly Stronger

- Determinism: the lab runtime makes OTP-style debugging reproducible (seeded schedules, trace capture/replay, schedule exploration).
- Cancel-correctness: cancellation is a protocol (request -> drain -> finalize), so covered OTP-style shutdown paths carry explicit budgets and can publish concrete cleanup bounds; non-cooperative paths retain the no-universal-bound caveat above.
- No silent leaks for runtime-tracked obligations: regions cannot close with live children or unresolved registered permits/acks/leases, so "forgot to reply" and "stale name" become runtime or test-oracle failures instead of silent success.

### Where To Look In The Repo

- Supervisor compilation/runtime: `src/supervision.rs`
- Name leases + registry plumbing: `src/cx/registry.rs`
- Node-local process-group value layer: `src/spork.rs` (`spork::process_group`)
- Minimal supervised Spork app walkthrough: `examples/spork_minimal_supervised_app.rs`
- AppSpec reference journey (declarative topology → lab proof): `examples/appspec_reference_journey.rs`, with the e2e artifact runner `scripts/run_appspec_reference_journey_e2e.sh` (emits `events.ndjson` + `summary.json` + `topology.txt`)
- Deterministic ordering contracts (Spork): `docs/spork_deterministic_ordering.md`
- Spork glossary + invariants: `docs/spork_glossary_invariants.md`
- Crash artifacts + canonical traces: `src/trace/crashpack.rs`

## Mathematical Foundations

Asupersync has formal semantics backing its engineering.

| Concept | Math | Payoff |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Outcomes** | Severity lattice: `Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked` | Monotone aggregation, no "recovery" from worse states |
| **Concurrency** | Near-semiring: `join (⊗)` and `race (⊕)` with laws | Lawful rewrites, DAG optimization |
| **Budgets** | Tropical semiring: `(ℝ∪{∞}, min, +)` | Critical path computation, budget propagation |
| **Obligations** | Linear-logic discipline: resources resolved exactly once (Rust is affine, so enforcement is `#[must_use]` + runtime leak detection, not purely static) | Leaked obligations are loudly detected at region close instead of silently dropped |
| **Traces** | Mazurkiewicz equivalence (partial orders) | DPOR-style guided exploration (not certified-optimal DPOR), stable replay |
| **Cancellation** | Two-player game with budgets | Completeness theorem: sufficient budgets guarantee termination |
| **Adaptive scheduling** | EXP3/Hedge no-regret online learning | Dynamic preemption control without fairness blind spots |
| **Drain certificates** | Martingales + Freedman/Azuma concentration | Quantified confidence that cancellation drain reaches quiescence |
| **Structural diagnostics** | Spectral graph theory + conformal + e-processes | Early warning on wait-graph fragmentation with calibrated alarms |

See [`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md`](./asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md) for the complete operational semantics.

## "Alien Artifact" Quality Algorithms

Asupersync is intentionally "math-forward": it uses advanced math and theory-grade CS where it supports concrete, scoped claims such as controlled-schedule determinism, covered-surface cancel-correctness, published cleanup bounds, and reproducible concurrency debugging. The mechanisms below exist in the codebase today, but their support posture is not uniform:

| Mechanism | Current status |
|-----------|----------------|
| EXP3/Hedge scheduler control | Implemented runtime scheduling control surface |
| Martingale drain certificates | Implemented cancellation progress diagnostics |
| Spectral wait-graph health | Implemented observability diagnostic; advisory early warning, not a standalone deadlock proof |
| Mazurkiewicz/Foata trace canonicalization and DPOR | Implemented lab/trace exploration machinery |
| Persistent homology trace scoring | Implemented lab exploration prototype; used to prioritize interesting schedules, not a production runtime gate |
| Sheaf-style saga consistency and TLA+ export | Implemented analysis/export surfaces for verification workflows |

### Online Control of Cancel Preemption (EXP3/Hedge)

`src/runtime/scheduler/three_lane.rs` includes a deterministic EXP3/Hedge controller that selects cancel-streak limits per epoch from observed reward (progress + fairness + deadline components). This is the scheduler's online-control layer: it adapts to workload regime shifts while preserving deterministic replay and explicit fairness bounds.

### Martingale Drain Certificates (Freedman + Azuma + Phase Labels)

`src/cancel/progress_certificate.rs` models cancellation drain as a stochastic progress process with auditable evidence, variance estimation, and concentration bounds. Freedman provides a tighter variance-aware bound; Azuma remains as conservative reference. Verdicts include phase classification (`warmup`, `rapid_drain`, `slow_tail`, `stalled`, `quiescent`) for operational clarity.

### Spectral Bifurcation Warnings on the Wait Graph

`src/observability/spectral_health.rs` computes Laplacian-spectrum diagnostics and an early-warning severity model (`none/watch/warning/critical`) over the live wait graph. It combines spectral trend analysis, nonparametric dependence tests, split-conformal next-step bounds, and an anytime-valid e-process, so structural degradation can be detected with calibrated confidence before hard failures.

Status: production-facing observability path. The classification is intentionally advisory: zero or falling spectral connectivity is a topology signal, while explicit trapped-cycle evidence remains a separate deadlock proof.

### Mazurkiewicz Trace Monoid + Foata Normal Form (DPOR Equivalence Classes)

Instead of treating traces as opaque linear logs, Asupersync factors out *pure commutations* of independent events via trace theory. Two traces that differ only by swapping adjacent independent events are considered equivalent, and canonicalized to a unique representative (Foata normal form). See `src/trace/canonicalize.rs`.

$$
M(\\Sigma, I) = \\Sigma^* / \\equiv_I
$$

Payoff: canonical fingerprints for schedule exploration and stable replay across "same behavior, different interleaving" runs.

### Geodesic Schedule Normalization (A* / Beam Search Over Linear Extensions)

Given a dependency DAG (trace poset), Asupersync constructs a valid linear extension that minimizes "owner switches" (a proxy for context-switch entropy) using deterministic heuristics and an exact bounded A* solver. See `src/trace/geodesic.rs` and `src/trace/event_structure.rs`.

Payoff: smaller, more canonical traces that are easier to diff, replay, and minimize.

### DPOR Race Detection + Happens-Before (Vector Clocks)

Asupersync includes DPOR-style race detection and backtracking point extraction, using a minimal happens-before relation (vector clocks per task) plus resource-footprint conflicts. See `src/trace/dpor.rs` and `src/trace/independence.rs`.

Payoff: systematic interleaving exploration that targets truly different behaviors instead of brute-force schedule fuzzing.

### Persistent Homology of Trace Commutation Complexes (GF(2) Boundary Reduction)

Schedule exploration is prioritized using topological signals from a square cell complex built out of commuting diamonds: edges are causality edges, squares represent valid commutations, and Betti numbers/persistence quantify "non-trivial scheduling freedom". The implementation uses deterministic GF(2) bitset linear algebra and boundary-matrix reduction. See `src/trace/boundary.rs`, `src/trace/gf2.rs`, and `src/trace/scoring.rs`.

Status: implemented lab exploration prototype. It feeds `TopologyExplorer` novelty scoring for deterministic schedule search; it is not a production scheduler policy, release gate, or runtime health alarm.

Payoff: an evidence-ledger, structure-aware notion of "interesting schedules" that tends to surface rare concurrency behaviors earlier.

### Sheaf-Theoretic Consistency Checks for Distributed Sagas

In distributed obligation tracking, pairwise lattice merges can hide *global* inconsistency (phantom commits). Asupersync models this as a sheaf-style gluing problem and detects obstructions where no global assignment explains all local observations. See `src/trace/distributed/sheaf.rs`.

Payoff: catches split-brain-style saga states that evade purely pairwise conflict checks.

### Anytime-Valid Invariant Monitoring (E-Processes, Ville's Inequality)

The lab runtime can continuously monitor invariants (task leaks, obligation leaks, region quiescence) using e-processes (`src/lab/oracle/eprocess.rs`). Separately, the production runtime provides an anytime-valid obligation-only leak monitor (`src/obligation/eprocess.rs`). Both use a supermartingale-based, anytime-valid testing framework that supports optional stopping without "peeking penalties".

Payoff: turn long-running exploration into statistically sound monitoring, with deterministic, explainable rejection thresholds.

### Distribution-Free Conformal Calibration for Oracle Metrics

Oracle anomaly thresholds are calibrated using split conformal prediction, giving finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees under exchangeability assumptions across deterministic schedule seeds. See `src/lab/conformal.rs`.

Payoff: stable false-alarm behavior under workload drift, without hand-tuned magic constants.

### Algebraic Law Sheets + Rewrite Engines With Side-Condition Lattices

Asupersync's concurrency combinators come with an explicit law sheet (severity lattices, budget semirings, race/join laws, etc.) and a rewrite engine guarded by conservative static analyses (obligation-safety and cancel-safety lattices; deadline min-plus reasoning). See `src/combinator/laws.rs`, `src/plan/rewrite.rs`, and `src/plan/analysis.rs`.

Payoff: principled plan optimization without silently breaking cancel/drain/quiescence invariants.

### TLA+ Export for Model Checking

Traces can be exported as TLA+ behaviors with spec skeletons for bounded TLC model checking of core invariants (no orphans, obligation linearity, quiescence). See `src/trace/tla_export.rs`.

Payoff: bridge from deterministic runtime traces to model-checking workflows when you need "prove it", not "it passed tests".

## Dependency budget contract

The checked
[`artifacts/dependency_budget_contract_v1.json`](artifacts/dependency_budget_contract_v1.json)
freezes the exact direct Cargo edge allowset and package-version plus
unique-package-name ceilings for every canonical synthesized-consumer
profile/platform cell. The focused `dependency-budget-contract` lane verifies
the current marginal-ledger fingerprint, profile/target/host/edge-kind
partitions, automatic downward ratchet, safe direct-edge and graph-growth
negative fixtures, and the narrow reviewed-exception path. See
[`docs/dependency_budget_contract.md`](docs/dependency_budget_contract.md).
This contract does not authorize dependency removal or cutover and is not a
broad workspace, runtime, security, performance, or release-readiness claim.

## Dependency supply-chain policy contract

The checked supply-chain gate is
[`scripts/ci/audit_dependencies.sh`](scripts/ci/audit_dependencies.sh), with
policy and interpretation in
[`artifacts/dependency_supply_chain_policy_v1.json`](artifacts/dependency_supply_chain_policy_v1.json)
and
[`docs/dependency_supply_chain_policy.md`](docs/dependency_supply_chain_policy.md).
Its focused proof lane is `dependency-supply-chain-policy-contract`. A root
scanner pass does not claim that the separately excluded fuzz workspace is
green; consult the live receipt for its explicit non-green status.

## Using Asupersync as a Dependency

### Cargo.toml

```toml
[dependencies]
# crates.io
asupersync = "0.3.5"

# or git
# asupersync = { git = "https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/asupersync", version = "0.3.5" }
```

### Feature Flags

### Minimum Supported Rust Version

Rust **nightly** remains the default contributor/release toolchain (Edition
2024, pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`) because default features include
`nightly-outcome-try`.

The checked stable subset is `cargo +stable` with default features disabled and
`proc-macros` enabled. Use `scripts/run_stable_lane_e2e.sh` for the canonical
local/RCH runner; it emits structured per-stage logs and a `summary.json` for
the stable-lane artifact.

### Semver Policy

- **0.x.y**: Breaking changes may ship in **0.(x+1).0**
- **1.x.y**: Breaking changes only in **(1+1).0.0**

See `docs/api_audit.md` for the current public API audit and stability notes.

### Core Exports

```rust
use asupersync::{
    // Capability context
    Cx, Scope,

    // Outcome types (four-valued result)
    Outcome, OutcomeError, PanicPayload, Severity, join_outcomes,

    // Cancellation
    CancelKind, CancelReason,

    // Resource management
    Budget, Time,

    // Error handling
    Error, ErrorKind, Recoverability,

    // Identifiers
    RegionId, TaskId, ObligationId,

    // Testing
    LabConfig, LabRuntime,

    // Policy
    Policy,
};
```

### Wrapping Cx for Frameworks

Framework authors (e.g., HTTP servers) should wrap `Cx`:

```rust
/// Framework-specific request context
pub struct RequestContext<'a> {
    cx: &'a Cx,
    request_id: u64,
}

impl<'a> RequestContext<'a> {
    pub fn is_cancelled(&self) -> bool {
        self.cx.is_cancel_requested()
    }

    pub fn budget(&self) -> Budget {
        self.cx.budget()
    }

    pub fn checkpoint(&self) -> Result<(), asupersync::Error> {
        self.cx.checkpoint()
    }
}
```

### HTTP Status Mapping

```rust
// Recommended HTTP status mapping:
// - Outcome::Ok(_)        → 200 OK
// - Outcome::Err(_)       → 4xx/5xx based on error type
// - Outcome::Cancelled(_) → 499 Client Closed Request
// - Outcome::Panicked(_)  → 500 Internal Server Error
```

## Configuration

### Lab Runtime Configuration

```rust
let config = LabConfig::default()
    // Seed for deterministic scheduling (same seed = same execution)
    .seed(42)

    // Maximum steps before timeout (prevents infinite loops)
    .max_steps(100_000)

    // Enable futurelock detection (tasks holding obligations without progress)
    .futurelock_max_idle_steps(1000)

    // Enable trace capture for replay
    .capture_trace(true);

let lab = LabRuntime::new(config);
```

Futurelock detection is tied to held obligations and poll progress, not just elapsed time. The detector compares current step against each task's `last_polled_step`, and can either emit violations or panic based on `panic_on_futurelock` (`src/lab/runtime.rs`, `src/lab/config.rs`).

Lab snapshots also support structural validation and integrity checks. `RestorableSnapshot` computes a deterministic content hash over the full serialized snapshot, so semantic tampering is detectable before replay analysis (`src/lab/snapshot_restore.rs`).

Runtime leak handling is configurable via `ObligationLeakResponse` (`Panic`, `Log`, `Silent`, `Recover`) with optional threshold-based escalation (`LeakEscalation`), and zero thresholds are normalized to one to avoid invalid policy states (`src/runtime/config.rs`).
If a leak is detected while the thread is already unwinding, a `Panic` response is downgraded to `Log` to avoid double-panic aborts; leak counting is also guarded against reentrant inflation (`src/runtime/state.rs`).

### Budget Configuration

```rust
let now = Time::from_secs(1_000); // current logical time from the runtime or lab clock

// Request timeout with poll budget
let request_budget = Budget::new()
    .with_timeout(now, Duration::from_secs(30))
    .with_poll_quota(10_000)      // Max 10k polls
    .with_priority(100);          // Normal priority

// Cleanup budget (tighter for faster shutdown)
let cleanup_budget = Budget::new()
    .with_timeout(now, Duration::from_secs(5))
    .with_poll_quota(500);
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ObligationLeak detected"

Your task completed while holding an obligation (permit, ack, lease).

```rust
// Wrong: permit dropped without send/abort
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
return Outcome::ok(());  // Leak!

// Right: always resolve obligations
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
permit.send(message);  // Resolved
```

### "RegionCloseTimeout"

A region is stuck waiting for children that won't complete.

```rust
// Check for: infinite loops without checkpoints
loop {
    cx.checkpoint()?;  // Add checkpoints in loops
    // ... work ...
}
```

### "FuturelockViolation"

A task is holding obligations but not making progress.

```rust
// Check for: awaiting something that will never resolve
// while holding a permit/lock
let permit = tx.reserve(cx).await?;
other_thing.await;  // If this blocks forever → futurelock
permit.send(msg);
```

### Deterministic test failures

Same seed should give same execution. If not:

```rust
// Check for: time-based operations
// WRONG: uses wall-clock time
let now = std::time::Instant::now();

// RIGHT: uses virtual time through Cx
let now = cx.now();
```

Also check for ambient randomness:

```rust
// WRONG: ambient entropy breaks determinism
let id = rand::random::<u64>();

// RIGHT: use capability-based entropy
let id = cx.random_u64();
```

To enforce deterministic collections in lab code, consider a clippy rule that
disallows `std::collections::HashMap/HashSet` in favor of `util::DetHashMap/DetHashSet`.

## Browser Edition (WASM)

Asupersync compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and ships a Browser Edition
that exposes the structured concurrency runtime to JavaScript and TypeScript
applications via `wasm-bindgen`.

### What works today

- **JS/TS consumers (GA)**: `@asupersync/browser` provides production-ready
  browser main thread and dedicated worker support. The shipped direct-runtime
  lane supports a real browser `window` + `document` + `WebAssembly` environment
  and dedicated workers when the required worker Web APIs are present.
- **Capability-gated browser transports**: shipped browser networking uses
  `fetch`, `WebSocket`, and an explicit WebTransport datagram lane when the
  host exposes `globalThis.WebTransport` over HTTPS.
- **Browser-native application-boundary helpers**: `@asupersync/browser` now
  exposes guarded `MessageChannel` / `MessagePort` / `BroadcastChannel` helpers
  and WHATWG `ReadableStream` / `WritableStream` byte wrappers. Construction
  requires explicit `BrowserNativeMessagingCapability` or
  `BrowserNativeStreamCapability` authority, denies `capability_not_granted`
  and `degraded_mode_denied`, and reports stable
  `ASUPERSYNC_BROWSER_NATIVE_*` error codes. The proof artifact is
  `artifacts/wave2/browser_native_message_and_stream_apis_evidence.json`.
- **Framework adapters on the browser main thread**: `@asupersync/react` and
  `@asupersync/next` remain client-rendered browser adapters layered on top of
  the same Browser Edition runtime boundary.
- **Rust repo/browser-build surface**: `asupersync` supports the
  canonical `wasm-browser-*` profile set, and the repository ships
  `asupersync-browser-core` plus `asupersync-wasm` for the JS ABI/package
  boundary. That is real Rust-side browser infrastructure, but it is not yet a
  stable external Rust consumer runtime lane.
- **Preview public Rust builder lane**: external Rust consumers now have a
  preview browser-runtime bootstrap path through `RuntimeBuilder::browser()`.
  It is dispatcher-backed, narrower than the shipped JS/TS Browser Edition
  packages, and truthful about fail-closed host support. The refreshed
  `asupersync-j1xbon.4` support decision keeps this lane
  artifact-contract-backed preview, not a stable external Rust Browser Edition
  API.
- **Core invariants preserved**: no orphan tasks, cancel-correctness,
  obligation accounting, and region-close-implies-quiescence all hold in
  the browser runtime.
- **Single-threaded cooperative model**: the scheduler yields back to the
  browser event loop between steps, preserving UI responsiveness.

### What does not work yet

- **Stable Rust-authored Browser Edition runtime lane**: external Rust
  consumers now have a preview browser-runtime bootstrap API through
  `RuntimeBuilder::browser()`, but it is intentionally narrower than the
  shipped JS/TS Browser Edition packages. The current Rust-facing path is
  dispatcher-backed and truthful about host support: supported hosts construct
  a preview browser runtime, while unsupported hosts fail closed to structured
  execution-ladder diagnostics rather than pretending full native-thread
  parity already exists. `asupersync-j1xbon.4` explicitly keeps this support
  class at artifact-contract-backed preview until the stable API, ABI policy,
  fixture logs, and docs are promoted together.
- **Service worker direct runtime**: intentionally broker/coordinator-only.
  The browser package keeps direct `BrowserRuntime` creation fail-closed inside
  `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`; use the bounded broker registration and durable
  handoff APIs instead.
- **Shared worker direct runtime**: intentionally broker/coordinator-only.
  Direct `BrowserRuntime` creation remains fail-closed inside
  `SharedWorkerGlobalScope`; use the bounded coordinator attach, version
  handshake, detach cleanup, and truthful fallback APIs instead.
- **Multi-threaded WASM**: the browser runtime is single-threaded.
  A future phase may add `SharedArrayBuffer` + Web Worker parallelism,
  but this requires cross-origin isolation headers that many deployments
  cannot enable.
- **Raw TCP/UDP, filesystem, process/signal**: these native-only surfaces
  are `cfg`-gated out on `wasm32`. Browser networking uses `fetch`,
  `WebSocket`, and capability-gated `WebTransport` datagrams instead.
- **Native host parity from browser-native helpers**: the public
  `MessageChannel` / `BroadcastChannel` / WHATWG stream helpers are guarded
  same-browser wrappers only. They do not imply raw transport parity,
  cross-origin federation, service/shared-worker direct runtime, filesystem or
  process access, or a public Rust `AsyncRead` / `AsyncWrite` browser-core
  wasm ABI.

### Quick start

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
# Verify the semantic core closes under a browser profile
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_wasm_browser_check cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown \
  --no-default-features --features wasm-browser-dev
```

```bash
# JS/TS SDK (not yet published to npm; use workspace-local packages for now)
# npm install @asupersync/browser
```

If you are authoring browser-facing code in Rust today, the truthful supported
lane is narrower: use the canonical `wasm-browser-*` profile checks for
semantic-core closure, use `asupersync-browser-core` / `asupersync-wasm` only
as the Rust-side ABI/package boundary, and use the maintained fixture workflow
at `tests/fixtures/rust-browser-consumer/` plus
`scripts/validate_rust_browser_consumer.sh` for the repository's proven
browser-facing Rust example. The repo now exposes a preview public
`RuntimeBuilder::browser()` lane for external Rust consumers, but the
fixture-driven workflow remains the authoritative evidence for this path.

For the preview Rust lane, inspect the truthful execution ladder before and
after requesting a lane:

```rust
let ladder = RuntimeBuilder::new().inspect_browser_execution_ladder();
let selection = RuntimeBuilder::browser().build_selection();
```

The key fields to inspect are `selected_lane`, `host_role`, `reason_code`,
`preferred_lane`, and `downgrade_order`.

See [`docs/WASM.md`](./docs/WASM.md) for the full Browser Edition guide,
architecture diagrams, crate map, the current Rust-authored browser contract,
and known limitations.

The checked Browser Edition readiness matrix is
[`artifacts/browser_edition_readiness_matrix_v1.json`](./artifacts/browser_edition_readiness_matrix_v1.json),
with the human review table in
[`docs/browser_edition_readiness_matrix.md`](./docs/browser_edition_readiness_matrix.md).
It binds Direct-runtime supported, Package ABI boundary, Preview public lane,
Broker/coordinator-only, Bridge-only, and Impossible / unsupported rows to
their fixture evidence, including vanilla/Vite and Webpack consumer lanes.

The scoped Browser Edition GA signoff packet is
[`artifacts/browser_ga_final_signoff_v1.json`](./artifacts/browser_ga_final_signoff_v1.json),
with the human report in
[`docs/browser_ga_final_signoff.md`](./docs/browser_ga_final_signoff.md). It
aggregates B1 readiness, B2 package integrity, and B3 consumer compatibility
for the JS/TS package line while keeping the Rust browser API preview-only.
JS/TS packages GA for browser main-thread and dedicated-worker consumers; Rust browser API preview-only.

## Limitations

### Current State

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Single-thread deterministic kernel | ✅ Complete |
| Parallel scheduler + work-stealing | ✅ Implemented (three-lane scheduler) |
| I/O reactor (Linux epoll + optional io_uring primary path; BSD/Windows reactors have narrower interest support) | ✅ Implemented |
| TCP, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, TLS | ✅ Implemented |
| WebSocket | ⚠️ Runtime surface shipped; live RFC6455 conformance coverage now wires extension negotiation plus broader framing/control/close/masking/fragmentation harnesses, with runtime e2e coverage still lane-specific |
| HTTP/3 (default static-only QPACK; opt-in dynamic QPACK field-section and instruction-stream state machine) | ⚠️ Partial implementation: dynamic QPACK field-section/table, Huffman strings, encoder/decoder instruction-stream processing, and bounded blocked-stream scheduling are supported in the native opt-in state machine. Static-only remains the default, and this is not a claim of h3/quinn drop-in parity or full QUIC deployment parity. |
| Database clients (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) | ✅ Implemented |
| Actor supervision (GenServer, links, monitors) | ✅ Implemented |
| DPOR-style race-guided seed exploration | ⚠️ Implemented as trace analysis, seed derivation, and equivalence-class telemetry; no exact-prefix backtracking or completeness claim |
| Distributed runtime (remote tasks, sagas, leases, recovery) | Protocol/state-machine, lease, idempotency, and saga surfaces implemented; virtual/lab baseline plus production TCP loopback RemoteRuntime lifecycle proof shipped; deployment discovery, TLS/authentication, WAN retry policy, and stable production wire format remain adapter-scoped |
| RaptorQ fountain coding for snapshot distribution | ✅ Implemented |
| Formal methods (TLA+ export + Lean-checked model-invariant coverage) | ⚠️ Partial implementation (Lean checks six abstract-model invariants; no production-Rust refinement proof or blanket adapter/protocol proof) |
| Browser Edition (WASM, JS/TS consumers) | ✅ Implemented for browser main-thread and dedicated-worker consumers (single-threaded, event-loop-driven) |
| Service worker direct runtime | Broker/coordinator-only; direct runtime unsupported, bounded broker/handoff supported |
| Shared worker direct runtime | Broker/coordinator-only; direct runtime unsupported, bounded coordinator attach/detach/fallback supported |
| Rust-to-WASM compilation path | Preview public lane exists via `RuntimeBuilder::browser()`, but current Rust support is still narrower than the shipped JS/TS packages and remains anchored by fixture/evidence validation |

### What Asupersync Doesn't Do

- **Cooperative cancellation only**: Non-cooperative code requires explicit escalation boundaries
- **Not a drop-in replacement for other runtimes**: Different API, different guarantees
- **No Tokio dependency compatibility by default**: runtime-specific crates that assume Tokio need explicit boundary adapters. The asupersync runtime crate's default production graph has no normal-edge dependency on tokio: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_readme_docs cargo tree -e normal -p asupersync -i tokio` should print `warning: nothing to print.` The optional `metrics` feature also has no normal-edge dependency on tokio: `rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_readme_docs cargo tree -e normal -p asupersync --features metrics -i tokio` should print the same warning. Two satellite workspace members carry tokio for documented purposes: `asupersync-tokio-compat` (opt-in API shims) and `conformance` (RFC vendor-comparison harnesses). Dev/test graphs pull tokio for reference implementations and `InMemoryMetricExporter` via `opentelemetry_sdk`'s `testing` feature. The `fuzz` feature is intentionally outside this guarantee because it enables `opentelemetry-proto`'s `gen-tonic-messages` path (`tonic`/`tonic-prost` -> `tokio`) for OTLP wire-format fuzz helpers. Workspace-wide, full-graph, and fuzz-enabled cargo-tree output is therefore an audit/quarantine surface, not the default or metrics production-consumer proof; full-graph cargo-tree output is likewise an audit surface, and unexpected paths should be remediated by removing the default/metrics edge or documenting a strictly scoped test/fuzz/satellite carve-out. See AGENTS.md "Documented carve-outs" and [`artifacts/no_tokio_feature_boundary_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/no_tokio_feature_boundary_contract_v1.json) for the canonical verification commands and rationale.

### Design Trade-offs

| Choice | Trade-off |
|--------|-----------|
| Explicit checkpoints | More verbose, but cancellation is observable |
| Capability tokens | Extra parameter threading, but testable and auditable |
| Two-phase effects | More complex primitives, but no data loss |
| Region ownership | Can't detach tasks, but no orphans |

---

## Roadmap

| Phase | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Single-thread deterministic kernel | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 1** | Parallel scheduler + region heap | ✅ Complete |
| **Phase 2** | I/O integration (Linux epoll, optional io_uring, TCP, HTTP/1.1-2, TLS, HTTP/3 native core with default static-only QPACK plus opt-in dynamic field-section context; BSD/Windows reactors currently expose narrower interest support) | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Phase 3** | Actors + supervision (GenServer, links, monitors) | ✅ Complete for live per-actor supervision (`src/actor.rs` drives restart-on-failure with backoff/intensity); the Spork `CompiledSupervisor` tree computes restart *plans* but its tree-level live restart loop is pending (`asupersync-8y37kz.2` / `asupersync-u2vgjg`) |
| **Phase 4** | Distributed structured concurrency | ✅ Core primitives complete; production remote network adapters remain support-class scoped |
| **Phase 5** | Schedule exploration + formal tooling | ⚠️ Partial (DPOR-style race-guided seed exploration, TLA+ export, and Lean-checked model invariants exist; exact-prefix DPOR and a production-Rust-to-model refinement proof do not) |
| **Phase 6** | Hardening, policy gates, and adapter surface expansion | ✅ Continuous (see [Policy Gates](#phase-6-policy-gates)) |

---

## Phase 6 Policy Gates

Phase 6 ships as a continuous hardening track rather than a one-shot release. The repository itself is main-only: agents land direct commits on `main`, then mirror the legacy compatibility ref as required by the repo workflow. Phase 6 therefore has two explicit enforcement lanes instead of a single PR-only story:

- **Direct-main agent lane:** before committing or pushing a substantive change, run the local `rch` preflight gates that apply to the touched surface and commit any required artifact with the change.
- **PR/release-review lane:** [`.github/workflows/methodology-gates.yml`](./.github/workflows/methodology-gates.yml) remains a PR-only GitHub Actions workflow for external review/release situations. It is CI-blocking for pull requests, but it is not the mechanism that protects normal agent commits to `main`.

The checked signoff for this split is [`artifacts/phase6_methodology_gate_enforcement_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/phase6_methodology_gate_enforcement_contract_v1.json), and [`tests/phase6_methodology_gate_contract.rs`](./tests/phase6_methodology_gate_contract.rs) verifies that this README, the signoff artifact, and the PR workflow agree about the enforcement mode.

### SLO Policy Proof Loop

The SLO-to-runtime lane is an opt-in direct-main proof loop for operator policy changes. It is grounded in the live schema, runtime application seam, deterministic replay evidence, and proof runner; it is not a separate docs-only process and it is not a blanket production enforcement claim outside the explicit SLO application/admission seam.

- Canonical artifact: [`artifacts/slo_policy_bundle_contract_v1.json`](./artifacts/slo_policy_bundle_contract_v1.json)
- Runtime API surface: [`src/types/slo_policy.rs`](./src/types/slo_policy.rs) defines the artifact/application contract, and [`src/runtime/slo_policy.rs`](./src/runtime/slo_policy.rs) provides the explicit `Cx`-scoped bridge through `SloRuntimePolicyBridge`, `SloRuntimePolicyBridgeRequest`, `SloRuntimePolicyBridgeDecision`, and `SloRuntimeWorkKind`. The artifact layer is exported through `SLO_POLICY_BUNDLE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `SLO_POLICY_COMPILER_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `SLO_POLICY_PROOF_REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `SLO_POLICY_RUNTIME_APPLICATION_SCHEMA_VERSION`, `validate_slo_policy_bundle_json`, `validate_slo_proof_report_json`, and `validate_slo_runtime_policy_application_json`
- Contract test: [`tests/slo_policy_bundle_contract.rs`](./tests/slo_policy_bundle_contract.rs)
- Operator script: [`scripts/validate_slo_policy_bundle.sh`](./scripts/validate_slo_policy_bundle.sh)

The artifact covers the policy bundle schema, compiler output, runtime application contract, LabRuntime replay evidence, brownout E2E receipts, proof-report gate, and runtime enforcement report in one JSON contract. The runtime bridge is intentionally narrower than a policy engine: callers pass an explicit `Cx`, work kind, and admission request, and the bridge records admitted, browned-out, cancelled, no-win, or blocked decisions while preserving region-close quiescence and explicit non-start/drain receipts. The compiler schema is `slo-budget-admission-compiler-v1`, the runtime application schema is `slo-runtime-policy-application-v1`, the replay contract is `slo-lab-replay-contract-v1`, the brownout E2E receipt schema is `slo-lab-brownout-e2e-receipt-v1`, the proof-report schema is `slo-proof-report-v1`, and the runtime enforcement report schema is `slo-runtime-enforcement-proof-report-v1`.

The brownout E2E receipt rows are deterministic LabRuntime evidence for healthy admit, optional-work brownout, no-win fallback, cancellation during brownout, and recovery after pressure clears. They include `receipt_status`, `region_ids`, `task_counts`, `obligation_state`, cancellation counters, drain counters such as `drain_completed_count`, finalizer counters such as `finalizer_completed_count`, `final_quiescent`, `runtime_invariant_violations`, `oracle_violations`, `operator_interpretation`, and explicit non-claims. Missing drain or finalizer evidence produces a red receipt.

The runtime enforcement report preserves `pass`, `degraded`, `no_win`, `blocked`, `stale_evidence`, `unsupported`, and `malformed` as separate outcomes. `pass` means admitted runtime work completed under the compiled policy. `degraded` means optional work browned out before violating the objective. `no_win` means the explicit no-win fallback receipt was selected. `blocked`, `stale_evidence`, `unsupported`, and `malformed` are fail-closed operator outcomes. Runtime JSONL rows emitted by `scripts/validate_slo_policy_bundle.sh` include `runtime_enforcement_status`, `runtime_admission_status`, `lab_replay_status`, `receipt_status`, admitted/rejected work counts, optional work browned out, cleanup deadline misses, `fallback_reason`, `issue_kinds`, `proof_command`, `proof_command_source`, `redaction_policy_id`, and the brownout E2E receipt fields. The script writes `slo-policy-bundle-run.json`, `slo-policy-bundle-run.md`, `slo-policy-bundle-events.ndjson`, and `slo-brownout-e2e-detail.log` under `target/slo-policy-bundle/<run-id>/`.

The proof report still preserves `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, `degraded`, `no_win`, `unsupported`, and `stale_evidence` as separate gate outcomes. The opt-in gate accepts only issue-free `pass`, `degraded`, and `no_win` reports. Only `pass` is counted as full success. Malformed reports, missing `rch exec` commands, stale profile hashes, missing no-win receipts, redaction failures, secret-like material, unsupported schema versions, missing required fields, and local `rch` fallback markers checked with `--check-rch-log` fail closed.

The direct-main proof command for this lane is:

```bash
rch exec -- bash scripts/validate_slo_policy_bundle.sh --output-root target/slo-policy-bundle --run-id asupersync-w5n9qp.5
```

Rust proof for artifact/API/doc consistency stays scoped to the touched crate:

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_slo_policy_docs CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings -C debuginfo=0' cargo test -p asupersync --test slo_policy_bundle_contract --features test-internals -- --nocapture
```

Focused runtime bridge proof:

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_slo_runtime_bridge CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings -C debuginfo=0' cargo test -p asupersync --test slo_policy_bundle_contract runtime_slo_policy_bridge --features test-internals -- --nocapture
```

Focused brownout E2E receipt proof:

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_slo_brownout_e2e CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings -C debuginfo=0' cargo test -p asupersync --test slo_policy_bundle_contract runtime_slo_brownout_lab_e2e --features test-internals -- --nocapture
```

Closeout validation for runtime bridge changes keeps the broad lanes explicit:

```bash
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_check_all_targets_ol11aa3 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings -C debuginfo=0' cargo check --all-targets
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_clippy_all_targets_ol11aa3 CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_PROFILE_TEST_DEBUG=0 RUSTFLAGS='-D warnings -C debuginfo=0' cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
rch exec -- env CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_fmt_check_ol11aa3 cargo fmt --check
```

### Gate matrix

| Gate | Direct-main trigger | Direct-main enforcement | PR workflow enforcement | Required artifact |
|------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Baseline benchmarks | Every substantive direct-main change before commit/push | Run the canonical `methodology_baselines` command from the signoff contract. Its post-benchmark gate compares every tracked p50 against `artifacts/baseline.json` at a fixed **5%** threshold in the same remote process. | **CI-blocking** for PRs. Fails if any benchmark's p50 regresses by more than **5%** vs `artifacts/baseline.json`. | `artifacts/baseline.json` plus criterion output. |
| Flamegraph | Direct-main changes under `src/runtime/scheduler/`, `src/channel/`, `src/obligation/`, `src/cancel/`, or `src/sync/` | Generate and commit `artifacts/flamegraphs/main-<bead-or-short-sha>.svg`.

The PR workflow `summary` job (`needs: [baseline-gate, flamegraph-gate, golden-checksum-gate, proof-note-gate]`, `if: always()`) posts a single PR comment that lists the four gates and their per-gate details. That workflow is all-green only when every triggered gate succeeds and every untriggered conditional gate skips. Direct-main commits do not depend on this PR comment path; they depend on the local preflight commands and committed artifacts recorded in the signoff contract.

### Direct-main preflight commands

Run only the gates that apply to the files you are landing. All cargo work stays behind strict `RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --` execution, has no local fallback, and is scoped to the `asupersync` crate. The Phase 6 baseline bench maps Criterion's live `median.point_estimate` to the tracked `p50_ns` after measurement in the same remote process, fails closed when any tracked row is missing, duplicated, malformed, or more than 5% slower, and leaves newly added candidate rows outside the gate until they are deliberately added to `artifacts/baseline.json`:

```bash
RCH_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SEC=5400 RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_baselines ASUPERSYNC_PHASE6_BASELINE=artifacts/baseline.json ASUPERSYNC_PHASE6_MAX_REGRESSION_PCT=5 cargo bench -p asupersync --bench methodology_baselines --features test-internals,criterion-benches -- --noplot
```

```bash
RCH_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SEC=5400 RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_golden_bench cargo bench -p asupersync --bench golden_output --features test-internals,criterion-benches -- --noplot
```

An intentional golden change uses a separate reviewed-update flow. Commit the
behavior change first, ensure the tracked tree is clean, and generate a complete
candidate from that exact commit. Update mode rejects a missing or mismatched
reviewed SHA, tracked dirt, partial scenario runs, stale extra rows, sentinel or
malformed hashes, and incomplete provenance. It atomically writes the candidate
under Criterion's artifact directory so RCH retrieves it without mutating the
tracked registry on the worker:

```bash
GOLDEN_REVIEWED_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
RCH_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SEC=5400 RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec --base HEAD --clean-overlay --no-overlay -- env GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 GOLDEN_REVIEWED_GIT_SHA=${GOLDEN_REVIEWED_SHA} CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_golden_update cargo bench -p asupersync --bench golden_output --features test-internals,criterion-benches -- --noplot
```

Review
`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_golden_update/criterion/golden-update/golden_checksums.json`
against `artifacts/golden_checksums.json`, then replace the tracked registry in a
separate commit only if every behavioral change and provenance row is intended.
Normal verification never accepts a missing registry, a `GENERATE` sentinel, or
missing/extra scenario keys.

```bash
RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_golden_test cargo test -j 4 -p asupersync --test golden_outputs --features test-internals -- --nocapture
```

```bash
RCH_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SEC=5400 RCH_REQUIRE_REMOTE=1 rch exec -- env CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 CARGO_TARGET_DIR=${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/rch_target_asupersync_phase6_flamegraph cargo flamegraph --package asupersync --freq 997 --features test-internals,criterion-benches --bench methodology_baselines -o artifacts/flamegraphs/main-<bead-or-short-sha>.svg
```

```bash
rch exec -- bash -lc 'test -f artifacts/proof_notes/main-<bead-or-short-sha>.md && test "$(wc -c < artifacts/proof_notes/main-<bead-or-short-sha>.md)" -ge 100'
```

### Rollout

All four gates are live today, but their enforcement lane matters. The PR workflow is **PR-only and CI-blocking** for pull-request/release-review events. Normal agent work on `main` is **locally enforced** by the `rch` preflight commands above plus the required committed artifacts. Push-on-main GitHub enforcement is not currently enabled, and the signoff contract records that explicitly.

Concrete escape valves are limited and intentional: a benchmark regression that reflects an intentional algorithmic change is resolved by re-recording `artifacts/baseline.json` (not by waiving the gate); a golden mismatch is resolved by committing the reviewed behavior change, running the fail-closed golden candidate flow above from that clean commit, reviewing the retrieved exact-set candidate, and committing the promoted registry separately (not by skipping the bench); a proof note that turns out to be insufficient is resolved by extending the note (not by removing it). The infrastructure intentionally has no `[skip ci]`-style waiver.

If you are landing a change that touches a hot-path or safety-critical directory, generate the artifact (flamegraph or proof note) before committing the change to `main`. Re-running validation without committing the required artifact does not satisfy the direct-main gate.

## FAQ

### Why "Asupersync"?

"A super sync": structured concurrency done right.

### Why not just use existing runtimes with careful conventions?

Conventions don't compose. The 100th engineer on your team will spawn a detached task. The library you depend on will drop a future holding a lock. Asupersync makes incorrect code unrepresentable (or at least detectable).

### How does this compare to structured concurrency in other languages?

Similar goals to Kotlin coroutines, Swift structured concurrency, and Java's Project Loom. Asupersync goes further with:
- Formal operational semantics
- Two-phase effects for cancel-safety
- Obligation tracking (linear resources)
- Deterministic lab runtime

### Can I use this with existing async Rust code?

Asupersync has its own runtime with explicit capabilities. For code that needs to interop with external async libraries, we provide boundary adapters that preserve our cancel-correctness guarantees. Those boundary surfaces are intentionally lane-scoped: some are fully supported today, some remain preview-public or guarded-canary, and some remain bridge-only. The canonical live support matrix is in [`docs/integration.md`](./docs/integration.md) and [`docs/WASM.md`](./docs/WASM.md).

### Is this production-ready?

Asupersync is active development software with a fully implemented core runtime surface (deterministic kernel, parallel scheduler, TCP/HTTP/TLS, database clients, distributed runtime primitives, actor/supervision model, and deterministic verification harnesses), plus a shipped WebSocket runtime lane whose live RFC6455 conformance coverage is still partial. Phase 6 hardening is still active for release gates and external-boundary/browser adapter maturity, so shipped support is lane-specific rather than blanket-GA across every adapter surface; use [`docs/integration.md`](./docs/integration.md) and [`docs/WASM.md`](./docs/WASM.md) as the live source of truth for support class and rollout posture. It is a strong fit for internal systems where correctness guarantees and deterministic debugging are primary requirements.

### AI Agent Skill

This repo ships with the full agent skill at [`skills/asupersync-mega-skill/`](./skills/asupersync-mega-skill/). It is meant for Claude Code / Codex-style agents working in this repo or using Asupersync from another Rust project.

If you want to install the repo's local skills into your detected global agent-skill directories, run [`./skills/install_asupersync_skill_globally.sh`](./skills/install_asupersync_skill_globally.sh). It uses `rsync`, detects Claude Code / Codex / Gemini from their commands or home directories, and prompts for confirmation before writing anything.

Use it when you want an agent to:

- migrate a Tokio / axum / hyper / tonic stack to native Asupersync,
- run the migration readiness planner and map its report rows back to the playbook,
- design a greenfield service around `Cx`, regions, `AppSpec`, supervision, and deterministic tests,
- debug cancellation, obligation leaks, futurelock, scheduler behavior, or replay artifacts,
- understand which Asupersync surfaces to lead with by default versus only use when the project explicitly needs them.

Typical trigger prompts:

- `Run the migration readiness planner and explain the operator report.`
- `Migrate this Tokio service to native Asupersync.`
- `Design this service around Cx, regions, AppSpec, and deterministic tests.`
- `Fix this cancellation / futurelock / obligation leak bug in Asupersync.`

The skill is intentionally opinionated:

- it pushes agents toward native Asupersync semantics rather than executor-swap thinking,
- it leads with core runtime, service/web/gRPC, channels/sync/combinators, and deterministic testing,
- it treats Browser Edition, QUIC/H3, messaging, remote/distributed, and RaptorQ as requirement-driven lanes rather than default starting points.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Quiescence** | The state where all spawned tasks have completed and no further progress is possible without external input. Used by the runtime to detect when `block_on` can return. |
| **Cx (Context)** | A cancel-propagation token threaded through async functions. Replaces tokio's implicit `JoinHandle::abort()` with explicit, structured cancellation. |
| **Region** | A structured concurrency scope that owns spawned tasks and ensures they complete (or are cancelled) before the region returns. Analogous to structured concurrency in languages like Kotlin or Java's Project Loom. |
| **block_on** | The entry point that bridges synchronous and asynchronous code. Runs a future to completion on the current thread, using the asupersync scheduler. |

## Contributing

> *About Contributions:* Please don't take this the wrong way, but I do not accept outside contributions for any of my projects. I simply don't have the mental bandwidth to review anything, and it's my name on the thing, so I'm responsible for any problems it causes; thus, the risk-reward is highly asymmetric from my perspective. I'd also have to worry about other "stakeholders," which seems unwise for tools I mostly make for myself for free. Feel free to submit issues, and even PRs if you want to illustrate a proposed fix, but know I won't merge them directly. Instead, I'll have Claude or Codex review submissions via `gh` and independently decide whether and how to address them. Bug reports in particular are welcome. Sorry if this offends, but I want to avoid wasted time and hurt feelings. I understand this isn't in sync with the prevailing open-source ethos that seeks community contributions, but it's the only way I can move at this velocity and keep my sanity.

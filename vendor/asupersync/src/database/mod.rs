//! Database clients with async wrappers and Cx integration.
//!
//! This module provides async wrappers for database clients, integrating with
//! asupersync's cancel-correct semantics and blocking pool.
//!
//! # Available Clients
//!
//! - [`sqlite`]: SQLite async wrapper using blocking pool (requires `sqlite` feature)
//! - [`postgres`]: PostgreSQL async client with wire protocol (requires `postgres` feature)
//! - [`mysql`]: MySQL async client with wire protocol (requires `mysql` feature)
//!
//! # Design Philosophy
//!
//! Database clients integrate with [`Cx`] for checkpointing and cancellation.
//! SQLite uses the blocking pool for synchronous operations, while PostgreSQL
//! and MySQL implement their respective wire protocols over async TCP.
//!
//! [`Cx`]: crate::cx::Cx
//!
//! # Deadline propagation (min-plus composition)
//!
//! Query timeouts compose with the ambient [`Cx`] budget through meet
//! semantics, mirroring the outbound HTTP/gRPC clients
//! (br-asupersync-server-stack-hardening-eeexl1.1.2): the effective
//! statement timeout for each query is `min(remaining Cx budget,
//! per-connection override)`. A database call therefore can never outlive
//! its caller's deadline, and each hop only ever tightens the bound. The
//! per-backend delivery mechanism is `SET statement_timeout` (PostgreSQL),
//! `SET SESSION max_execution_time` (MySQL, `SELECT`-only by server
//! semantics), and a deadline-checking progress handler (SQLite).
//!
//! On cancellation observed mid-query, each client performs a wire-level
//! cancel inside the drain phase — PostgreSQL `CancelRequest` on a fresh
//! socket, MySQL `KILL QUERY` on a fresh connection, SQLite
//! `sqlite3_interrupt` — and only resolves the operation as `Cancelled`
//! after the wire cancel has completed (or its connection-close fallback
//! has been taken and logged).

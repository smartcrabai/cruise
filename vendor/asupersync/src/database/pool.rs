//! Generic database connection pool with health checks.
//!
//! Provides a database-specific abstraction over [`sync::Pool`](crate::sync::Pool)
//! with connection validation, lifecycle management, and typed connection managers.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::database::pool::{DbPool, ConnectionManager, DbPoolConfig};
//!
//! struct PgManager { url: String }
//!
//! impl ConnectionManager for PgManager {
//!     type Connection = PgConnection;
//!     type Error = PgError;
//!
//!     fn connect(&self) -> Result<Self::Connection, Self::Error> {
//!         PgConnection::connect(&self.url)
//!     }
//!
//!     fn is_valid(&self, conn: &Self::Connection) -> bool {
//!         conn.ping().is_ok()
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! let pool = DbPool::new(PgManager { url: db_url }, DbPoolConfig::default());
//! let conn = pool.get()?;

//! Multipath symbol aggregation infrastructure.
//!
//! This module provides symbol aggregation from multiple transport paths:
//! - `TransportPath`: Represents a single transport path with characteristics
//! - `PathSet`: Manages multiple paths to a destination
//! - `SymbolDeduplicator`: Filters duplicate symbols
//! - `SymbolReorderer`: Buffers and reorders symbols
//! - `MultipathAggregator`: Main aggregation orchestrator

//! Supervision policies for actor failure handling.
//!
//! This module implements Erlang/OTP-style supervision semantics that are compatible
//! with asupersync's region ownership and cancellation model:
//!
//! - **Region-owned restarts**: Restarts happen within the same region scope
//! - **Budget-aware**: Restart loops consume budget and respect deadlines
//! - **Monotone escalation**: Cannot downgrade a worse outcome
//! - **Trace-visible**: All supervision decisions are logged for debugging
//!
//! # Supervision Strategies
//!
//! - [`SupervisionStrategy::Stop`]: Stop the actor on any error
//! - [`SupervisionStrategy::Restart`]: Restart on error with rate limiting
//! - [`SupervisionStrategy::Escalate`]: Propagate failure to parent region
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::supervision::{SupervisionStrategy, RestartConfig};
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! // Stop on any error
//! let stop = SupervisionStrategy::Stop;
//!
//! // Restart up to 3 times in 60 seconds
//! let restart = SupervisionStrategy::Restart(RestartConfig {
//!     max_restarts: 3,
//!     window: Duration::from_mins(1),
//!     backoff: BackoffStrategy::Exponential {
//!         initial: Duration::from_millis(100),
//!         max: Duration::from_secs(10),
//!         multiplier: 2.0,
//!     },
//! });
//!
//! // Escalate to parent
//! let escalate = SupervisionStrategy::Escalate;
//! ```

///    H0 the false-alarm probability accumulates toward 1 over a long horizon
///    (CUSUM/ARL semantics, not anytime validity).

///    overlapping [`RestartIntensityWindow`], so observations are serially
///    correlated and the per-observation `E[LR] ≤ 1` premise holds only
///    approximately.

/// check in [`Supervisor`] remains the hard bound on restart intensity.

/// Each restart is an observation. The monitor takes the current restart
/// intensity (from a [`RestartIntensityWindow`]) and computes a likelihood

///
/// ```text

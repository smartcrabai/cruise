//! ATP verifier pipeline primitives.
//!
//! The verifier is the fail-closed boundary between bytes that arrived from a
//! peer, relay, cache, or local disk and bytes that may be exposed as committed
//! ATP data. This module is intentionally independent from the sparse writer
//! and append-only journal so callers can validate chunks, object graphs,
//! repair symbols, proof bundles, and finalizer evidence before those lower
//! layers are complete.

//! Graded/quantitative types for obligations and budgets.
//!
//! Explores an opt-in type layer where obligations carry resource annotations,
//! making "no obligation leaks" a type error (or at minimum a `#[must_use]`
//! warning + panic-on-drop) for code using the graded surface.
//!
//! # Typing Judgment Sketch
//!
//! The graded type discipline assigns resource weights to obligation values:
//!
//! ```text
//! Γ ⊢ reserve(K)    : Obligation<K>     [creates 1 unit of resource K]
//! Γ, x: Obligation<K> ⊢ commit(x) : ()  [consumes 1 unit of resource K]
//! Γ, x: Obligation<K> ⊢ abort(x)  : ()  [consumes 1 unit of resource K]
//!
//! // Scope rule: exit with 0 outstanding obligations
//! Γ ⊢ scope(body) : τ    iff    Γ_exit has no live Obligation<K> values
//! ```
//!
//! In a fully linear type system, forgetting to consume an obligation would
//! be a *type error*. Rust is affine (values may be dropped silently), not
//! linear. We approximate linearity with:
//!
//! 1. **`#[must_use]`**: Compiler warns if an `Obligation<K>` is ignored.
//! 2. **Drop bomb**: `Drop` impl panics if the obligation was not resolved.
//!    In debug/lab mode this catches leaks immediately. In release mode,
//!    this can be replaced with a log+metric.
//! 3. **API shape**: The only ways to disarm the drop bomb are `commit()`,
//!    `abort()`, or `into_raw()` (escape hatch for FFI/tests).
//!
//! # Resource Semiring
//!
//! The graded annotation forms a semiring over obligation counts:
//!
//! ```text
//! (ℕ, +, 0, ×, 1)
//! ```
//!
//! - `0`: no obligation held (empty)
//! - `1`: one obligation held (reserve)
//! - `+`: sequential composition (obligations accumulate)
//! - `×`: parallel composition (obligations from both branches)
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use asupersync::obligation::graded::{GradedObligation, Resolution};
//! use asupersync::record::ObligationKind;
//!
//! // Correct usage: obligation is resolved before scope exit.
//! let ob = GradedObligation::reserve(ObligationKind::SendPermit, "test permit");
//! ob.resolve(Resolution::Commit);
//!
//! // This would panic on drop:
//! // let leaked = GradedObligation::reserve(ObligationKind::Ack, "leaked");
//! // drop(leaked); // PANIC: obligation leaked!
//! ```

//! Guarded Recursion Lens: Time-Indexed Behavior for Actors and Leases.
//!
//! This module captures the guarded recursion / "later" modality lens as a
//! concrete design note tied to actor and lease APIs in asupersync.
//!
//! # Background: What is Guarded Recursion?
//!
//! In type theory, the **later modality** (written `▸A` or `later(A)`) delays
//! a type by one time step. Guarded recursion allows defining infinite
//! (coinductive) behaviors safely: a self-referencing definition is productive
//! if every recursive occurrence is guarded by `▸`.
//!
//! For example, an infinite stream `Stream A = A × ▸(Stream A)` is well-defined
//! because the recursive reference `Stream A` appears only under `▸`.
//!
//! # How This Maps to Asupersync
//!
//! Asupersync's runtime is inherently step-indexed via its deterministic lab
//! runtime (virtual time advances in discrete steps) and its explicit state
//! machines. The "later" modality is realized concretely:
//!
//! ## Actors as Guarded Fixed Points
//!
//! An actor's behavior unfolds one message at a time:
//!
//! ```text
//! ActorBehavior<S, M> = S × (M → ▸(ActorBehavior<S, M>))
//! ```
//!
//! This reads: an actor has a current state `S` and a handler that, given a
//! message `M`, produces the *next* behavior (guarded by `▸`). The `handle()`
//! method implements this unfolding:
//!
//! ```text
//! step(t):
//!   msg ← mailbox.recv()       // blocks until message or close
//!   self.handle(cx, msg)        // mutate state, may spawn sub-tasks
//!   → ▸(step(t+1))             // next step is "later"
//! ```
//!
//! The guard ensures:
//! - **Productivity**: Each step processes exactly one message.
//! - **Termination**: The loop terminates when the mailbox closes
//!   (mailbox close = coinductive termination signal).
//! - **Cancel safety**: `on_stop` runs after the mailbox drains, providing a
//!   clean finalization phase.
//!
//! ## Leases as Time-Indexed Obligations
//!
//! A lease is a time-indexed obligation that transitions through states:
//!
//! ```text
//! LeaseEvolution(t) =
//!   | Active { expires_at }  if t < expires_at
//!   | Expired                if t ≥ expires_at ∧ ¬renewed
//!   | Released               if holder released before expiry
//! ```
//!
//! The renewal operation extends the "active" window:
//!
//! ```text
//! renew(lease, duration, now):
//!   requires: lease.state(now) = Active
//!   ensures:  lease.expires_at' = now + duration
//!   effect:   shifts the ▸ boundary forward in time
//! ```
//!
//! Key insight: **renewal is a re-guarding operation**. It moves the
//! `▸`-boundary (expiry) into the future, keeping the lease "productive"
//! (active). Without renewal, the lease becomes "non-productive" (expired)
//! after a fixed number of time steps.
//!
//! ## Region Lifecycle as Step-Indexed Protocol
//!
//! ```text
//! RegionProtocol = Open → ▸(Closing → ▸(Draining → ▸(Finalizing → ▸(Closed))))
//! ```
//!
//! Each transition is guarded: a region cannot skip phases. The guard ensures
//! that children complete before the parent finalizes (structured concurrency).
//!
//! ## Budget Consumption as Decreasing Sequence
//!
//! A budget is a monotonically decreasing resource:
//!
//! ```text
//! budget(t+1) ≤ budget(t)     (deadline approaches, polls consumed)
//! ```
//!
//! This is the dual of guarded recursion: instead of producing one step of
//! output, we consume one step of resource. The budget reaching zero is the
//! inductive termination condition.
//!
//! # Practical Payoff
//!
//! The primary payoff of the guarded recursion lens is **time-indexed lease
//! renewal reasoning**:
//!
//! 1. **Liveness proof**: If a lease is renewed every `d` units with duration
//!    `d`, it is always active. This is a coinductive argument: `active(t)`
//!    implies `active(t + d)` via renewal.
//!
//! 2. **Expiry proof**: An unrenewed lease expires at exactly
//!    `created_at + initial_duration`. This is an inductive argument with
//!    base case at creation time.
//!
//! 3. **Nested deadline monotonicity**: If a lease lives inside a region with
//!    deadline `D`, the lease's expiry cannot exceed `D`. This is the
//!    deadline monotonicity invariant: `lease.expires_at ≤ region.deadline`.
//!
//! 4. **Actor restart reasoning**: A supervised actor restarts with fresh
//!    state, but the restart itself is a `▸`-guarded step. This means the
//!    restart protocol is well-founded (no infinite restart loops without
//!    time advancing).
//!
//! # Constraints for Future Phases
//!
//! See [`PreservationConstraint`] for the machine-readable checklist.

//! Runtime obligation ledger — central registry for linear token tracking.
//!
//! The ledger is the runtime's single source of truth for obligation lifecycle.
//! Every acquire/commit/abort flows through here, making leaks structurally
//! impossible when the ledger is used correctly.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! 1. Every obligation ID is unique and issued exactly once.
//! 2. Every obligation transitions through exactly one path:
//!    `Reserved → Committed` or `Reserved → Aborted` or `Reserved → Leaked`.
//! 3. Region close requires zero pending obligations for that region.
//! 4. Double-resolve panics (enforced by `ObligationRecord`).
//!
//! # Integration
//!
//! The ledger is designed to be held by the runtime state and queried by:
//! - The scheduler (to check quiescence conditions)
//! - The leak oracle (to verify invariants in lab mode)
//! - The cancellation protocol (to abort obligations during drain)

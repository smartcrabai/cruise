//! Cancellation reason and kind types.
//!
//! Cancellation in Asupersync is a first-class protocol, not a silent drop.
//! This module defines the types that describe why and how cancellation occurred.
//!
//! # Cleanup Budget Policy
//!
//! Every cancellation carries a **cleanup budget** that bounds the resources
//! available for cleanup code (drop glue, finalizers, obligation discharge).
//! The policy is **severity-scaled**: more urgent cancellations get tighter
//! budgets but higher scheduling priority.
//!
//! | CancelKind | Poll Quota | Priority | Rationale |
//! |------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
//! | User | 1000 | 200 | Graceful; user expects orderly shutdown |
//! | Timeout/Deadline | 500 | 210 | Time-driven; moderate cleanup window |
//! | PollQuota/CostBudget | 300 | 215 | Budget violation; tight but fair |
//! | FailFast/RaceLost/Parent/Resource | 200 | 220 | Cascading; fast teardown needed |
//! | Shutdown | 50 | 255 | Urgent; minimal cleanup, max priority |
//!
//! ## Min-Plus Rules (Budget Interaction)
//!
//! When a task receives multiple cancellation requests, the cleanup budgets
//! are **combined** via the meet (∧) operation from the budget algebra
//! (see `Budget::combine`). This means:
//!
//! - Poll quotas: min (tighter quota wins)
//! - Priority: max (higher urgency wins)
//!
//! This ensures that strengthening a cancellation never *increases* the
//! cleanup budget — the monotone-narrowing property from the budget
//! semilattice is preserved.
//!
//! ## Bounded Completion Guarantee
//!
//! Because cleanup budgets have finite poll quotas:
//!
//! 1. Each `consume_poll()` call strictly decreases the remaining quota
//!    (Lemma 7 in `types::budget::tests`)
//! 2. After exactly `poll_quota` polls, the budget is exhausted
//!    (Lemma 10 in `types::budget::tests`)
//! 3. An exhausted budget causes the scheduler to stop polling the task
//!
//! Therefore cleanup terminates within `poll_quota` poll cycles, which
//! is the **sufficient-budget termination** property.
//!
//! ## Calibration Guidelines
//!
//! - **Production**: Use default quotas. If cleanup routines need more
//!   polls (e.g., flushing large buffers), increase the User/Timeout
//!   quotas proportionally but keep Shutdown ≤ 100.
//! - **Lab/Testing**: Use `Budget::MINIMAL` (100 polls) for fast
//!   deterministic runs. Set `ASUPERSYNC_CLEANUP_BUDGET_OVERRIDE` env
//!   var to override all cleanup quotas for calibration experiments.
//! - **Backpressure**: Priority elevation (200–255) ensures cancelled
//!   tasks get scheduled promptly even under load, preventing
//!   indefinite queueing of cleanup work.
//!
//! # Attribution
//!
//! Each cancellation reason includes full attribution information:
//! - **Origin**: The region and optionally task that initiated the cancellation
//! - **Timestamp**: When the cancellation was requested
//! - **Cause chain**: Optional chain of parent causes for debugging
//!
//! This enables debugging and diagnostics to trace cancellation back to its source.
//!
//! # Memory Management
//!
//! Cause chains can grow unboundedly deep in complex cancellation scenarios.
//! To prevent unbounded memory growth, use [`CancelAttributionConfig`] to set limits:
//!
//! - `max_chain_depth`: Maximum depth of cause chain to preserve (default: 16)
//! - `max_chain_memory`: Maximum total memory for cause chain (default: 4KB)
//!
//! When chains exceed limits, they are truncated with a clear marker.
//!
//! ## Memory Cost Analysis
//!
//! Memory cost per `CancelReason`:
//! - Base: ~80 bytes (ids, timestamp, kind, flags)
//! - Message: variable (static &str pointer = 16 bytes)
//! - Cause: recursive (Box pointer = 8 bytes + child cost)
//!
//! Total cost for chain of depth D with no messages:
//! ```text
//! cost = 80 * D + 8 * (D-1)  // ~88 bytes per level
//! ```
//!
//! Default limits (depth=16, memory=4KB) allow chains up to ~45 levels
//! but prefer depth limiting for predictability.

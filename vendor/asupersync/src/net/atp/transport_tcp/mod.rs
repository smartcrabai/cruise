//! ATP-over-TCP transport (v1).
//!
//! The first transport that moves real file bytes between machines, verified,
//! over [`crate::net::TcpStream`] / [`crate::net::TcpListener`].
//!
//! This module replaces the CLI/daemon facade documented in
//! `asupersync-qk02uw` (fake sleep-loop progress that opened no socket). It
//! reuses the real ATP building blocks: the canonical `AtpFrameCodec` wire
//! format, the content-addressed `ObjectGraph` / `MerkleRoot` integrity model,
//! and SHA-256 content hashing.
//!
//! See `docs/atp_tcp_transport_v1.md` for the protocol diagram and rationale
//! (TCP first; native QUIC is a later opt-in transport).
//!
//! # Memory (bounded / streaming)
//!
//! Neither side ever holds a whole file — let alone the whole transfer — in
//! memory. The sender makes a streaming hash pass over each file, sends the
//! manifest, then re-streams the bytes; the receiver writes each entry straight
//! to a staging file while hashing it incrementally. Peak resident memory is
//! `O(chunk_size)` (default 256 KiB), independent of transfer size.
//!
//! # Integrity (fail-closed)
//!
//! The receiver streams each entry to a per-transfer staging file while hashing
//! it incrementally, then (1) compares every entry's streamed SHA-256 to the
//! manifest and (2) rebuilds the flat object-graph merkle root from the
//! per-entry digests and compares it to the manifest root. Only if both hold
//! does it commit each entry with a per-entry atomic rename or link/create
//! operation and report `committed = true`. Any mismatch, short read, oversize
//! entry, unreachable peer, or rejected handshake is a hard error — there is no
//! success path that moves zero bytes.

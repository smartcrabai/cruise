//! ATP-over-QUIC transport (Phase B scaffold).
//!
//! This module is the public-API skeleton for the *adaptive RaptorQ-over-QUIC*
//! data plane — the production ATP transport meant to beat rsync on lossy,
//! high-latency internet paths. It deliberately mirrors the public surface of
//! [`crate::net::atp::transport_tcp`] *exactly* so callers (the `atp` CLI, the
//! `atpd` daemon, fleet/loopback E2E harnesses) can target QUIC by swapping the
//! transport module and config type, with no other call-site changes.
//!
//! # Status: partially wired (`asupersync-arq-quic-epic-b0k8qo.2`)
//!
//! The endpoint-level send/receive coroutines still land in:
//!
//! - [`send_path`] → `asupersync-arq-quic-epic-b0k8qo.2.2` (B2: QUIC sender
//!   coroutine — connect, verify identity, manifest, encode + spray RaptorQ
//!   symbols across QUIC DATAGRAMs, fountain feedback).
//! - [`receive_once`] consumes one connection already routed into a
//!   [`ManagedQuicEndpoint`] and delegates to the wired accepted-connection
//!   receiver body. Live endpoint pumping and persistent serving remain B3
//!   follow-up work.
//! - [`serve`] drains connections already routed into a
//!   [`ManagedQuicEndpoint`] and delegates each one to the same accepted-
//!   connection receiver body. Live endpoint pumping and indefinite listener
//!   ownership remain native endpoint follow-up work.
//!
//! Until a given transfer entry point is wired, it **fails closed**: it
//! validates its configuration, emits a structured config summary, and returns
//! [`QuicTransportError::NotImplemented`]. There is no code path that reports a
//! fake success or moves zero bytes silently — the epic's non-negotiable
//! "every unwired op fails closed (typed error, never fake success)" rule.
//! [`receive_connection`] is the first wired B3 receiver surface: it consumes an
//! already-established native QUIC connection, verifies decoded entries, commits
//! them under the destination root, and returns a real report. [`receive_once`]
//! now removes a routed endpoint connection and drives that same body. [`serve`]
//! drains the currently routed queue with per-connection callbacks. Live
//! endpoint event-loop pumping and sender-side [`send_path`] native
//! connect/identity wiring remain fail-closed until their B2/B3 slices land.
//!
//! # Why a scaffold can land ahead of the Phase A data plane
//!
//! The tracker gates Phase B on Phase A (`...b0k8qo.1`, the QUIC application
//! data plane). That ordering is real for the *implementation* in B2/B3, which
//! consumes the Phase A DATAGRAM/STREAM/packet-protection surfaces. The
//! first scaffolds, however, only depended on already-landed pieces: the shared
//! bounded-memory helpers in [`crate::net::atp::transport_common`] (F0) and the
//! `transport_tcp` template it mirrors. The accepted-connection
//! [`receive_connection`] body now consumes the landed Phase A native STREAM and
//! DATAGRAM surfaces, while the still-unwired endpoint operations continue to
//! fail closed.
//!
//! # Reused wire / report types
//!
//! The manifest, receipt, and report types are intentionally **reused** from
//! [`crate::net::atp::transport_tcp`] (re-exported below) rather than
//! re-declared, so QUIC and TCP transfers commit to the byte-identical
//! manifest/merkle schema. A later refactor may hoist these into
//! `transport_common`; the re-export keeps the QUIC public surface stable
//! across that move.
//!
//! # Integrity & current memory boundary
//!
//! The accepted-connection receiver keeps `transport_tcp`'s fail-closed
//! integrity guarantee (per-entry SHA-256 + rebuilt flat-object-graph merkle
//! root vs. the manifest, atomic commit only on a full match). The native UDP
//! QUIC sender uses file-backed encoders that read one source block at a time,
//! and the receiver stages decoded blocks directly to disk before final
//! verification/commit. The in-memory encoder/decoder helpers remain for unit
//! tests and scaffold-only drivers; they are not the B5 bounded-memory proof
//! path.

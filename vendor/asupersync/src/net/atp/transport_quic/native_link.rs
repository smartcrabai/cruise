//! Real native-QUIC connect/accept + 1-RTT UDP data-plane pump for ATP-over-QUIC.
//!
//! This module is the wiring that turns [`super::send_path`] / the native receive
//! entry from a fail-closed scaffold into an actual transfer over a real UDP
//! socket. It composes three already-landed, separately-proven pieces — none of
//! which previously talked to each other in production — entirely over their
//! public APIs, so no peer-owned Phase-A file
//! (`connection.rs`/`connection_manager.rs`/`managed_endpoint.rs`) is modified:
//!
//! 1. [`QuicHandshakeDriver`] runs the genuine `rustls::quic` TLS-1.3 handshake
//!    over a [`QuicUdpEndpoint`] (real WebPKI server-identity verification, no
//!    insecure skip-verify), yielding a [`RustlsQuicCryptoProvider`] holding the
//!    derived 1-RTT keys.
//! 2. [`AtpPacketProtection::from_provider`] adopts those handshake-derived keys
//!    for the data plane (AEAD protect/unprotect + anti-replay), with no key
//!    re-derivation.
//! 3. [`NativeQuicConnection`] is driven to `Established` and produces/consumes
//!    application STREAM (control) + DATAGRAM (RaptorQ symbol) frames via
//!    `generate_frames` / `process_packet_payload`. A [`QuicLink`] pump protects
//!    each generated 1-RTT packet, sends it over UDP, and unprotects received
//!    packets back into the connection.
//!
//! The reliable ATP control protocol (Hello / manifest / NeedMore / Proof /
//! Close) and the fountain feedback loop are the existing `super::` native
//! helpers; this module adds the async UDP pump plus the ATP-scoped stream PTO
//! that requeues lost control-stream offsets while the peer is waiting at a
//! protocol boundary. The in-memory loopback driver ([`super`]'s tests) moves
//! frames synchronously between two in-process connections, which cannot do real
//! async socket I/O.
//!
//! # 1-RTT wire framing (no-claim boundary)
//!
//! The handshake itself uses canonical protected long-header Initial/Handshake
//! packets (the driver's responsibility). The 1-RTT data plane here uses a
//! deliberately simplified short packet: a 9-byte clear header
//! (`0x40 | key_phase`, then the full 8-byte packet number, big-endian) used as
//! AEAD associated data, followed by `ciphertext || tag`. This mirrors the
//! handshake driver's explicit "both ends are asupersync, no QUIC header
//! protection" simplification. It is therefore **not** wire-interoperable with a
//! generic QUIC stack (no header protection, no truncated packet numbers, no
//! connection-ID demux on the short header) and is scoped to ATP-over-QUIC where
//! both peers run this code. A wire-conformant short header + header protection
//! + multi-connection demux is separate Phase-A/Phase-D work.
//!
//! # Loss posture (no-claim boundary)
//!
//! RaptorQ + the fountain feedback loop tolerate symbol-DATAGRAM loss
//! end-to-end. The reliable control STREAM has bounded, ATP-specific
//! retransmission for setup, round-complete, NeedMore, and terminal Proof
//! frames; full generic QUIC loss recovery remains out of scope for this pump.
//! Deterministic symbol loss for tests is injected before a symbol is sprayed
//! ([`QuicConfig::debug_drop_one_in`]).

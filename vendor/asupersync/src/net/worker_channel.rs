//! MessagePort-based coordination utilities for browser main-thread / worker
//! runtime communication.
//!
//! Bead: asupersync-18tbo.3
//!
//! This module provides the typed coordination layer that sits between raw
//! `postMessage` usage and application code. It defines a structured message
//! protocol for:
//!
//! - **Bootstrap readiness**: worker reports initialization status
//! - **Work dispatch**: main thread sends work requests with region/task IDs
//! - **Cancellation**: main thread requests cancellation of in-flight work
//! - **Graceful shutdown**: coordinated worker lifecycle termination
//! - **Diagnostic events**: structured error/status reporting
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The protocol is defined as Rust types that serialize to JSON for the
//! structured-clone boundary. All messages carry explicit region and
//! sequence metadata so the coordination path remains compatible with
//! Asupersync's structured concurrency and deterministic replay.
//!
//! # Browser Integration
//!
//! On `wasm32` targets, the coordinator and endpoint integrate with the
//! [`BrowserReactor`] through its `register_message_port()` API, delivering
//! events via the reactor's token-based readiness model.

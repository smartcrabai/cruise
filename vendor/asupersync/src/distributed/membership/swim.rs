//! Pure SWIM + Lifeguard failure-detection protocol state machine.
//!
//! This is the transport-free, clock-free *core* of the membership subsystem
//! (bead `asupersync-dist-otp-completeness-8y37kz.4.1`). It is a deterministic
//! function of its inputs:
//!
//! ```text
//! (incoming Packet | timer tick)  ->  (outgoing Packets + membership events + new state)
//! ```
//!
//! There is **no I/O anywhere** in this module: time is a `u64` millisecond
//! value supplied by the caller, peer selection draws from a seeded
//! [`DetRng`], and every message is a typed value rather than bytes. The lab
//! virtual transport ([`super`] bead `.4.2`) and the UDP adapter (bead `.4.4`)
//! wrap this core; they map a real or virtual clock and a wire format onto the
//! same state machine. This separation (protocol vs. transport) follows the
//! established [`crate::remote`] pattern.
//!
//! # Protocol summary
//!
//! SWIM ([Das, Gupta, Motivala, DSN 2002]) detects failures with `O(1)`
//! per-node probe load instead of the `O(n)` of all-to-all heartbeating:
//!
//! 1. Each protocol period the node directly **pings** one peer (chosen by
//!    randomized round-robin).
//! 2. If no **ack** arrives within the RTT timeout, it asks `k` other peers to
//!    **ping-req** the target indirectly — this distinguishes a target failure
//!    from local-link trouble.
//! 3. If neither the direct nor any indirect probe is acked by period end, the
//!    target is marked **Suspect** and that suspicion is gossiped.
//! 4. A suspected node that hears about its own suspicion **refutes** it by
//!    incrementing its **incarnation** number and flooding an `Alive` rumor
//!    that supersedes the suspicion.
//! 5. If the suspicion is not refuted within the suspicion timeout, the target
//!    is **confirmed dead** and that is gossiped (terminal).
//!
//! Lifeguard ([Dadgar, Phillips, Currey, DSN-W 2018]) adds local-health
//! awareness (see [`super::lifeguard`]) so a degraded *local* node stretches
//! its own timeouts rather than wrongly accusing healthy peers, and shrinks the
//! suspicion window as independent confirmations accumulate.

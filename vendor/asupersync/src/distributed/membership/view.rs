//! Watchable membership view + peer process-group (bead
//! `asupersync-dist-otp-completeness-8y37kz.4.2`, AC3).
//!
//! The pure [`swim::Swim`](super::swim::Swim) state machine emits
//! [`MembershipEvent`]s via `drain_events` (single-consumer) and exposes its own
//! alive set. [`MembershipView`] decouples *observers* from that driver: a
//! driver feeds it the Swim's drained events, and any number of observers query
//! the current membership snapshot — the **peer process-group** ([`alive_peers`])
//! — and consume the **watchable event stream** by tracking a cursor into the
//! append-only log ([`events_since`]).
//!
//! This is the seam the lease manager (bead `.4.3`) subscribes to: it advances a
//! cursor over the event stream and reacts — `Suspect` pauses new lease grants
//! to a node, `Dead`/`Left` revoke its leases through the obligation protocol —
//! without coupling to the Swim's internals (see the suspicion → obligation
//! revocation design note in [`super`]).
//!
//! Pure and transport-free; an async broadcast-push wrapper over a runtime
//! channel can layer on top, but observers can already watch via the cursor.
//!

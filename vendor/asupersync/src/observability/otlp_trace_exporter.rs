//! OTLP trace exporter with load shedding for high-throughput span processing.
//!
//! **AUDIT SCOPE**: This module addresses the critical gap in OTLP trace export
//! under high load (10,000+ spans/sec). Previously, only metrics had load shedding.
//!
//! **OTLP BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED**:
//! - Bounded span export queue with configurable capacity
//! - Drop OLDEST span batches when queue is full (preserve recent data)
//! - Track dropped spans count in `otel.exporter.dropped_spans` metric
//! - Maintain FIFO export order
//! - Background batch processing with configurable timeout

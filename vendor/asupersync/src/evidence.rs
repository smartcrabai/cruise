//! Spork Evidence Ledger Schema + Deterministic Rendering (bd-2dfoo)
//!
//! Every Spork decision — supervision, registry, link/monitor — produces a
//! structured evidence record explaining *why* the decision was made and
//! *which constraint was binding*.  This module defines the unified schema
//! and a deterministic rendering format.
//!
//! # Design Principles
//!
//! 1. **Deterministic**: Evidence rendering is a pure function of the record.
//!    Identical inputs always produce identical output (byte-for-byte).
//! 2. **Test-assertable**: Records can be compared structurally, and rendered
//!    output can be matched against expected strings in tests.
//! 3. **Module-agnostic**: The `EvidenceRecord` envelope is the same regardless
//!    of which Spork subsystem produced it; the `detail` field carries the
//!    subsystem-specific constraint.
//! 4. **Append-only**: Ledgers only grow.  Entries are never mutated or removed.
//!
//! # Schema Overview

//! ├── timestamp: u64 (virtual nanoseconds)
//! ├── task_id: TaskId
//! ├── region_id: RegionId
//! ├── subsystem: Subsystem (Supervision | Registry | Link | Monitor)
//! ├── detail: EvidenceDetail (enum over subsystem-specific constraints)
//! └── verdict: Verdict (one-word outcome: Restart, Stop, Escalate, Accept, Reject, Propagate, …)

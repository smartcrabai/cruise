//! Error types and error handling strategy for Asupersync.
//!
//! This module defines the core error types used throughout the runtime.
//! Error handling follows these principles:
//!
//! - Errors are explicit and typed (no stringly-typed errors)
//! - Errors compose well with the Outcome severity lattice
//! - Panics are isolated and converted to `Outcome::Panicked`
//! - Errors are classified by recoverability for retry logic
//!
//! # Error Categories
//!
//! Errors are organized into categories:
//!
//! - **Cancellation**: Operation cancelled by request or timeout
//! - **Budgets**: Resource limits exceeded (deadlines, quotas)
//! - **Channels**: Communication primitive errors
//! - **Obligations**: Linear resource tracking violations
//! - **Regions**: Ownership and lifecycle errors
//! - **Encoding**: RaptorQ encoding pipeline errors
//! - **Decoding**: RaptorQ decoding pipeline errors
//! - **Transport**: Symbol routing and transmission errors
//! - **Distributed**: Distributed region coordination errors
//! - **Internal**: Runtime bugs and invalid states
//!
//! # Recovery Classification
//!
//! All errors can be classified by [`Recoverability`]:
//! - `Transient`: Temporary failure, safe to retry
//! - `Permanent`: Unrecoverable, do not retry
//! - `Unknown`: Recoverability depends on context

//! Trait abstraction over runtime backing-state shapes for the scheduler hot
//! path. br-asupersync-30atgp.1 — first decomposition step of br-asupersync-30atgp.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `ThreeLaneScheduler` and `ThreeLaneWorker` currently lock
//! `Arc<ContendedMutex<RuntimeState>>` and call a small handful of methods
//! on the locked guard. `ShardedState`
//! (`src/runtime/sharded_state.rs`) reduces lock contention by splitting
//! the unified table into independently-locked Tasks/Regions/Obligations
//! shards. Routing the scheduler through `ShardedState` requires a way to
//! ask "give me a task record, given an id" without committing the
//! caller to a particular backing-store implementation.
//!
//! This module defines [`RuntimeStateBacking`], the minimal surface the
//! scheduler hot path actually needs. Callers interact with the trait;
//! concrete implementations route to `RuntimeState` or, in a follow-up
//! bead, `ShardedState` via [`ShardGuard`].
//!
//! # Surface (audited 2026-05-07)
//!
//! Method calls on a locked state guard in the scheduler hot path
//! (worker.rs lines 200-700, three_lane.rs lines <5000, excluding test
//! code):
//!
//! - `task(task_id) -> Option<&TaskRecord>`
//! - `task_mut(task_id) -> Option<&mut TaskRecord>`
//! - `task_completed(task_id) -> TaskCompletionEffects`
//! - `store_spawned_task(task_id, stored)`
//! - `remove_stored_future(task_id) -> Option<StoredTask>`
//! - `drain_ready_async_finalizers() -> SmallVec<[(TaskId, u8, TaskSpawnEffects); 2]>`
//! - `tasks_iter()` — iterator over `(ArenaIndex, &TaskRecord)`
//!
//! Plus one field access: `state.now: Time` at
//! `three_lane.rs::ThreeLaneScheduler::current_scheduler_time`. That is
//! exposed as [`RuntimeStateBacking::current_time`].
//!
//! `tasks_iter` is intentionally NOT in the trait — it returns
//! `impl Iterator<Item = (ArenaIndex, &TaskRecord)>` which cannot be
//! abstracted without GATs or boxing. Callers that need iteration today
//! (a small set, mostly observability + cancel propagation) pull the
//! concrete type and iterate directly. The trait can be widened later.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! This commit lands ONLY the trait + the `RuntimeState` impl. No
//! scheduler call site is changed yet — `ThreeLaneScheduler` still takes
//! `Arc<ContendedMutex<RuntimeState>>` directly.
//!
//! - **30atgp.2** (next): implement `RuntimeStateBacking` for
//!   `Arc<ShardedState>` by routing each method through
//!   `ShardGuard::for_*` builders so cross-table atomicity at
//!   `task_completed` and `drain_ready_async_finalizers` is preserved.
//! - **30atgp.3** (after): parameterize `ThreeLaneScheduler` over the
//!   trait, flip the `RuntimeBuilder::with_sharded_state(true)` gate
//!   in `src/runtime/builder.rs` to construct a real `ShardedState`,
//!   run the swarm-coordination workload corpus on both shapes per the
//!   br-asupersync-9kuias acceptance bar.

//! Metamorphic property tests for work-stealing fairness (br-asupersync-umttcl).
//!
//! These tests verify three invariants of the work-stealing scheduler under
//! heavy contention:
//!
//! * **MR-WS1** — **Work conservation under multi-worker contention**:
//!   for N workers and M tasks, every task is polled exactly once; total polls
//!   equal M; no task is lost or duplicated regardless of steal interleaving.
//! * **MR-WS2** — **LIFO own-queue vs FIFO steal preservation**: when the owner
//!   pushes [t0, t1, ..., tK] to its LocalQueue, the owner's pop order is the
//!   reverse (LIFO) and a peer's steal order is the forward order (FIFO).
//!   This is the metamorphic dual: `reverse(owner_pops) == stealer_pops` over
//!   the same initial queue.
//! * **MR-WS3** — **No starvation**: under heavy contention with W >= M workers
//!   and a single injector, no worker is locked out for more than K ticks while
//!   ready work remains visible across the fleet.

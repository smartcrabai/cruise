//! Spawn mailbox: lock-free spawn-request intake decoupled from `RuntimeState`.
//!
//! Today every spawn must hold the global `RuntimeState` lock while
//! `create_task` runs. The spawn mailbox is the first half of the fix
//! (br-asupersync-dx-core-api-v2-u1z5hn.1): callers pre-allocate a
//! *provisional* [`TaskId`] from a sharded allocator, package the erased
//! future plus its spawn parameters into a [`SpawnRequest`], and enqueue it
//! onto the [`SpawnMailbox`] **without touching `RuntimeState`**. The
//! scheduler performs admission (region liveness check, task-record
//! insertion, obligation hookup) at dispatch time under the state lock it
//! already holds; that half lands separately
//! (br-asupersync-dx-core-api-v2-u1z5hn.1.3), as does region pending-spawn
//! quiescence accounting (br-asupersync-dx-core-api-v2-u1z5hn.1.2).
//!
//! # Provisional task-id namespace
//!
//! Arena-allocated `TaskId`s carry small generations: fresh slots start at
//! generation 0 and the generation increments once per slot reuse. The
//! mailbox mints ids in a disjoint namespace by setting the generation MSB
//! ([`SPAWN_ID_GENERATION_TAG`]): an arena id would need 2^31 reuses of a
//! single slot to collide, which is unreachable in practice. Layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! generation = TAG(bit 31) | shard(bits 30..24) | epoch(bits 23..0)
//! index      = low 32 bits of the per-shard allocation counter
//! ```
//!
//! Uniqueness proof sketch: distinct shards produce distinct generations, so
//! ids from different shards never collide; within one shard a single atomic
//! `fetch_add` produces a strictly increasing 56-bit (epoch, index) pair, so
//! ids from the same shard never collide before 2^56 allocations per shard.
//! Admission maps a provisional id to its canonical arena id (or adopts it,
//! once the sharded task table lands); the mapping policy is owned by the
//! admission bead.
//!
//! # Capacity and backpressure
//!
//! The mailbox is **unbounded** ([`GlobalFifoQueue`] wraps a lock-free
//! `SegQueue` on native targets, a mutexed `VecDeque` on wasm). `enqueue`
//! never blocks and never drops a request — silent drop is forbidden by the
//! spawn-mailbox contract. Backpressure is an *admission-side* concern:
//! region quotas reject spawn requests with an explicit `SpawnError` when
//! they are admitted, and region close resolves every pending request through
//! [`SpawnRequest::resolve_cancelled`] so the completion slot always learns
//! the outcome. The task-handle cancellation-command lane is also unbounded.
//! Producers coalesce identical or weaker reasons per handle and consumers
//! coalesce each drained batch, but neither lane has a hard in-memory backlog
//! bound; queue depth is an operational pressure signal, not a region-quota
//! guarantee.
//!
//! # Trace ordering
//!
//! [`SpawnMailbox::enqueue`] emits [`TraceEventKind::TaskSpawnEnqueued`]
//! *before* the request is published to the queue. The trace buffer
//! serializes sequence allocation with insertion, so the enqueue event's
//! sequence number is always ordered before any admission-side event for the
//! same request (a consumer can only observe the request after the push).

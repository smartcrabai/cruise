//! Proof-carrying decision-plane kernel for runtime controllers.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical [`RuntimeKernelSnapshot`] that controllers
//! observe, the [`ControllerRegistration`] contract they must satisfy, and the
//! [`ControllerRegistry`] that validates and manages controller participation.
//!
//! # Design Principles
//!
//! - **Narrow surface**: Snapshot fields are the minimum needed for decision-making.
//!   Adding a field requires explicit justification and version bump.
//! - **Deterministic**: Snapshot creation and serialization are deterministic given
//!   the same runtime state, enabling replay and comparison.
//! - **Auditable**: Every controller action is traced with snapshot ID, version,
//!   and decision metadata for post-hoc analysis.
//! - **No ambient authority**: Controllers receive snapshots; they cannot reach
//!   into runtime internals directly.
//!
//! # Versioning
//!
//! Snapshots carry a [`SnapshotVersion`] that controllers declare support for.
//! The registry rejects controllers whose expected version range does not overlap
//! with the current snapshot version. Controllers consuming a reduced snapshot
//! (fewer fields than the full version) remain in shadow mode until they upgrade.

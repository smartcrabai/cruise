//! Lightweight, feature-gated runtime instrumentation counters.
//!
//! This module is the measurement substrate for the scheduler/timer
//! CPU-efficiency overhaul (epic `asupersync-runtime-cpu-overhaul-5vt09v`).
//! You cannot prove a scheduler or timer fix without before/after numbers, and
//! the only externally visible signal (OS thread count) is far too coarse and
//! noisy. These counters expose the precise internal events the epic targets:
//! thread-per-`sleep` churn, `sched_yield` busy-spin, worker park/unpark
//! traffic, and the live timer population.
//!
//! # Zero cost when disabled
//!
//! Every counter and every `record_*` helper is gated behind the
//! `runtime-metrics` Cargo feature. When the feature is **off** (the default,
//! and what ships in release builds), each `record_*` call inlines to an empty
//! body and [`snapshot`] returns an all-zero [`Metrics`]. There is no static,
//! no atomic, and no instruction emitted on the hot path. The benchmark harness
//! (`asupersync-runtime-cpu-overhaul-5vt09v.2`) and the unit/e2e tests turn the
//! feature on to read and assert the counters.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! The atomics use [`Ordering::Relaxed`]. These counters are diagnostics, not
//! synchronization primitives: a reader only needs an eventually-consistent
//! tally, never a happens-before edge to the work being counted. Relaxed keeps
//! the instrumentation as close to free as an atomic increment can be.
//!
//! # Reading the counters
//!
//! Counters are process-global and monotonic (except the derived
//! [`Metrics::active_timers`] gauge). Tests and the bench should read a
//! [`snapshot`] before driving work and another after, then assert on the
//! *delta*. That pattern is robust to other tests incrementing the same global
//! counters in parallel; relying on absolute values is not.

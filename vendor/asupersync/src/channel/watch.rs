//! Two-phase watch channel for state broadcasting.
//!
//! A watch channel is a single-value channel where multiple receivers see the
//! latest value. Essential for configuration propagation, state sharing, and
//! shutdown signals.
//!
//! # Watch Semantics
//!
//! - Single producer broadcasts state changes
//! - Multiple receivers observe the latest value
//! - Receivers can wait for changes
//! - No queue - only the latest value matters
//!
//! # Cancel Safety
//!
//! The `changed()` method is cancel-safe:
//! - Cancel during wait: clean abort, version not updated
//! - Resume: continue waiting for same version
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::channel::watch;
//!
//! // Create a watch channel with initial value
//! let (tx, mut rx) = watch::channel(Config::default());
//!
//! // Receiver waits for changes
//! scope.spawn(cx, async move |cx| {
//!     loop {
//!         rx.changed(cx).await?;
//!         let config = rx.borrow_and_clone();
//!         apply_config(config);
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Sender updates the value
//! tx.send(new_config)?;
//! ```

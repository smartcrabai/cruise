//! Channel Flow Control Invariant Validator
//!
//! Ensures flow control mechanisms don't violate channel atomicity or cause deadlocks
//! when combined with cancellation and backpressure. This is critical for maintaining
//! the two-phase commit protocol integrity under load.
//!
//! # Flow Control Invariants
//!
//! 1. **Backpressure Safety**: Flow control never blocks reserve operations indefinitely
//! 2. **Cancel Compatibility**: Cancellation properly unblocks flow-controlled operations
//! 3. **Deadlock Prevention**: Circular wait conditions are detected and prevented
//! 4. **Atomicity Preservation**: Two-phase protocol remains atomic under backpressure
//! 5. **Resource Fairness**: Flow control doesn't cause starvation of any producers

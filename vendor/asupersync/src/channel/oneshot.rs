//! # Cancel Safety
//!
//! The two-phase pattern ensures cancellation at any point is clean:
//!
//! - If cancelled during reserve: sender is consumed, receiver sees Closed
//! - If cancelled after reserve but before send: permit drop aborts cleanly
//! - The commit operation (`send`) either delivers the value or returns it in
//!   `SendError::Disconnected` if the receiver has already closed
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::channel::oneshot;
//!
//! // Create a oneshot channel
//! let (tx, mut rx) = oneshot::channel::<i32>();
//!
//! // Two-phase send pattern (explicit reserve)
//! let permit = tx.reserve(&cx).expect("cx not cancelled in test");
//! permit.send(42)?;
//!
//! // Or convenience method
//! // tx.send(42);  // reserve + send in one step
//!
//! // Receive
//! let value = rx.recv(&cx).await?;
//! ```

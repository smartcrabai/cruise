//! Convergent state lattice for distributed obligation and lease state.
//!
//! In a distributed system, obligation and lease states may be observed at
//! different replicas with different orderings. This module defines a
//! join-semilattice that ensures convergence: merging state from any two
//! replicas yields the same result regardless of order.
//!
//! # State Lattice
//!
//! The obligation lifecycle forms a lattice:
//!
//! ```text
//!     Conflict (⊤)
//!      /      \
//!  Committed  Aborted
//!      \      /
//!     Reserved
//!        |
//!     Unknown (⊥)
//! ```
//!
//! - `Reserved ⊔ Committed = Committed` (committed supersedes reserved)
//! - `Reserved ⊔ Aborted = Aborted` (aborted supersedes reserved)
//! - `Committed ⊔ Aborted = Conflict` (protocol violation — should never happen)
//! - `Unknown ⊔ X = X` (unknown is the bottom element)
//! - `Conflict ⊔ X = Conflict` (conflict absorbs everything)
//!
//! The merge operation is associative, commutative, and idempotent.

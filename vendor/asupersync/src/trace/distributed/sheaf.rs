//! Sheaf-theoretic consistency checks for distributed sagas.
//!
//! # Problem Statement
//!
//! In a distributed saga, multiple nodes observe obligation states independently.
//! Pairwise merging (via the [`LatticeState`] join-semilattice) detects when two
//! nodes disagree on a single obligation. But pairwise checks can miss *global*
//! inconsistencies where:
//!
//! - Each pair of nodes appears locally consistent, yet
//! - No single global assignment satisfies all constraints.
//!
//! # Concrete Example
//!
//! Consider a saga with three steps (obligations O1, O2, O3) that must be
//! *all-or-nothing*. Three nodes observe:
//!
//! - Node A: O1=Committed, O2=Committed, O3=Reserved
//! - Node B: O1=Committed, O2=Reserved,  O3=Committed
//! - Node C: O1=Reserved,  O2=Committed, O3=Committed
//!
//! **Pairwise**: merging any two nodes via `LatticeState::join` produces
//! `Committed` for each obligation — no conflicts detected.
//!
//! **Globally**: No single node has observed all three as Committed. The
//! "committed everywhere" view is a *phantom*: it exists in the pairwise merge
//! but not in any actual node's observation. If the saga requires a coordinator
//! to witness all-committed before finalizing, this state is inconsistent.
//!
//! # Sheaf Interpretation
//!
//! - **Open cover**: Each node's observation is a "local section" over its view.
//! - **Presheaf condition**: Local sections must agree on overlaps (shared obligations).
//! - **Global section**: A globally consistent state that restricts to each
//!   local observation — exists iff local sections are compatible.
//! - **H¹ ≠ 0**: When local sections cannot be glued into a global section,
//!   there is a topological obstruction (the "split-brain" signal).
//!
//! # What This Module Detects
//!
//! The [`SagaConsistencyChecker`] takes a set of `NodeSnapshot`s (each node's
//! local view of saga obligation states) and a set of `SagaConstraint`s
//! (atomicity requirements like "all-or-nothing") and reports:
//!
//! 1. **Pairwise conflicts**: obligations where two nodes directly disagree.
//! 2. **Phantom commits**: obligations that appear committed in the merge but
//!    were never observed as committed by any single node.
//! 3. **Constraint violations**: saga constraints (e.g., all-or-nothing) that
//!    hold in the pairwise merge but are violated by the actual observations.

//! Authentication keys and key derivation.
//!
//! Keys are 256-bit (32 byte) values used for HMAC-SHA256 authentication.
//!
//! Uses `ZeroizeOnDrop` for secure memory cleanup (br-asupersync-4cs8my).
//!
//! # Security Enhancements (asupersync-mjn8rx)
//!
//! This module has been hardened against key forgery attacks:
//!
//! - **Enforced entropy validation**: All key creation paths now validate entropy
//!   to prevent weak keys, including `from_seed()` and `from_rng()` which previously
//!   bypassed validation and could enable signature forgery via weak keys.
//! - **Strengthened thresholds**: Minimum entropy requirements raised from 3.1% to 25%
//!   bit density (64-192 bits set out of 256), with 16+ distinct byte values required.
//! - **Concentration attack prevention**: No byte value may appear >4 times in a key.
//! - **HKDF key strengthening**: Weak RNG or seed output is automatically strengthened
//!   using HKDF rather than rejected, ensuring availability while maintaining security.
//! - **Defense in depth**: Multiple validation layers prevent various attack vectors.

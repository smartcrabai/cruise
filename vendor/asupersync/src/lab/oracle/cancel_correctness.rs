//! Cancel-Correctness Property Oracle
//!
//! This oracle continuously verifies that the cancellation protocol is followed
//! correctly, ensuring every cancel request leads to proper drain → finalize → complete(cancelled)
//! transitions without violations.
//!
//! # Key Detection Capabilities
//!
//! - **Protocol violations**: Illegal state transitions in cancel protocol
//! - **Premature completion**: Tasks completing without proper draining
//! - **Stuck cancellations**: Tasks not progressing through cancel protocol
//! - **Missing finalize steps**: Tasks skipping finalization before completion
//! - **Race conditions**: Concurrent cancellation state update violations
//! - **Post-completion witnesses**: Late stale witnesses reopening completed tasks
//!
//! # Integration Points
//!
//! - Hooks into `CancelWitness` validation in `types::cancel`
//! - Monitors cancellation state transitions per task/region
//! - Provides diagnostics with stack traces and cancellation path visualization
//! - Configurable enforcement modes (warn vs panic)

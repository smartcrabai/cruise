//! Cancellation protocol oracle for verifying the cancellation invariant.
//!
//! This oracle verifies invariant #3: Cancellation is a protocol.
//! Tasks must transition through request → drain → finalize in a bounded way.
//!
//! Additionally, this oracle verifies **INV-CANCEL-PROPAGATES**:
//! When a region is cancelled, all its descendant regions also have cancel set.
//!
//! # The Protocol
//!
//! Valid cancellation transitions for a task:
//! ```text
//! Created/Running → CancelRequested → Cancelling → Finalizing → Completed(Cancelled)
//! ```
//!
//! Key properties:
//! - Cancellation is idempotent (repeated requests strengthen but don't break protocol)
//! - Mask deferral is bounded (eventually checkpoint must acknowledge)
//! - Cleanup budgets are respected
//! - Cancel propagates downward through the region tree
//!
//! # Runtime Integration
//!
//! When the `cancel-correctness-oracle` feature is enabled, this oracle provides
//! real-time cancellation protocol verification during development and testing:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use asupersync::lab::oracle::cancellation_protocol::{CancellationProtocolOracle, CancelCorrectnessConfig};
//!
//! // Configure for runtime use
//! let config = CancelCorrectnessConfig {
//!     enforcement: EnforcementMode::Warn, // or Panic
//!     capture_stacks: true,
//!     max_violations_tracked: 100,
//! };
//! let mut oracle = CancellationProtocolOracle::with_config(config);
//!
//! // Runtime hooks automatically call these methods:
//! oracle.on_region_create(region, parent);
//! oracle.on_task_create(task, region);
//! oracle.on_cancel_request(task, reason, time);
//! oracle.on_transition(task, from, to, time);
//! oracle.on_region_cancel(region, reason, time);
//!
//! // Check for violations
//! if let Err(violation) = oracle.check() {
//!     match config.enforcement {
//!         EnforcementMode::Warn => eprintln!("Cancel protocol violation: {}", violation),
//!         EnforcementMode::Panic => panic!("Cancel protocol violation: {}", violation),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Zero-Cost Compilation
//!
//! When the `cancel-correctness-oracle` feature is disabled, all oracle operations
//! compile to no-ops with zero runtime overhead.

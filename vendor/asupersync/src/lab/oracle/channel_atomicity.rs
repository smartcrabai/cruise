//! Channel Atomicity Verification Framework
//!
//! This oracle verifies that channel operations maintain atomicity guarantees
//! in the presence of cancellation, ensuring that the two-phase reserve/commit
//! protocol prevents data loss and maintains consistent state.
//!
//! # Core Guarantees Verified
//!
//! 1. **Reservation Lifecycle**: Every reservation must be either committed or aborted
//! 2. **No Double Operations**: Cannot commit/abort the same reservation twice
//! 3. **No Use After Operations**: Cannot use reservation after commit/abort
//! 4. **Waker Consistency**: Lost/spurious wakeups detection and prevention
//! 5. **Cancel-Safe Operations**: No data loss when operations are cancelled
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use asupersync::lab::oracle::channel_atomicity::{
//!     ChannelAtomicityConfig, ChannelAtomicityOracle, ChannelId, EnforcementMode, ReservationId,
//! };
//!
//! let mut oracle = ChannelAtomicityOracle::new(ChannelAtomicityConfig {
//!     track_reservations: true,
//!     track_wakers: true,
//!     enforcement: EnforcementMode::Panic,
//!     structured_logging: true,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! });
//!
//! // Hook into channel operations.
//! let channel_id = ChannelId(1);
//! let committed = ReservationId(1);
//! let aborted = ReservationId(2);
//! oracle.on_reservation_created(committed, channel_id, None);
//! oracle.on_reservation_committed(committed, 64);
//! oracle.on_reservation_created(aborted, channel_id, None);
//! oracle.on_reservation_aborted(aborted, "sender cancelled".to_string());
//! ```

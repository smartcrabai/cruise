//! Channel Waker Deduplication Verifier
//!
//! This oracle verifies that the Arc<AtomicBool> waker deduplication pattern
//! in channels correctly prevents spurious wakeups while ensuring no lost wakeups.
//! Incorrect implementation can cause deadlocks where tasks aren't properly woken.
//!
//! # Core Patterns Verified
//!
//! 1. **Queued State Consistency**: Arc<AtomicBool> accurately reflects queued state
//! 2. **No Lost Wakeups**: Tasks that should be woken are actually woken
//! 3. **No Spurious Wakeups**: Tasks aren't woken unnecessarily
//! 4. **Race-Free Registration**: Waker registration doesn't race with wakeup
//! 5. **Proper Cleanup**: Dropped wakers are properly cleaned up
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use asupersync::lab::oracle::waker_dedup::{
//!     ChannelId, EnforcementMode, WakerDedupConfig, WakerDedupOracle, WakerId,
//! };
//!
//! let mut oracle = WakerDedupOracle::new(WakerDedupConfig {
//!     track_queued_state: true,
//!     track_wakeup_events: true,
//!     enforcement: EnforcementMode::Panic,
//!     max_tracked_wakers: 10000,
//!     ..Default::default()
//! });
//!
//! // Hook into waker operations.
//! let waker_id = WakerId(1);
//! let channel_id = ChannelId(1);
//! oracle.on_waker_registered(waker_id, channel_id, true, None);
//! oracle.on_waker_wake_requested(waker_id, "send completed".to_string(), None);
//! oracle.on_waker_actually_woken(waker_id, None);
//! oracle.on_waker_dropped(waker_id);

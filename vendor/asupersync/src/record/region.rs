/// # Concurrency-Safety Argument

/// Every admission path (`add_task`, `add_cleanup_task`, `add_child`,
/// `try_reserve_obligation`, `heap_alloc`) follows an optimistic state check
/// before mutating:
///
/// 1. **Fast-path reject** — atomic `state.load(Acquire)` checks the relevant
///    admission predicate (`can_accept_work()` for normal tasks/obligations,
///    `can_accept_cleanup_work()` for cleanup tasks,
///    `can_spawn()` for children). If false, return `Closed` without locking.
/// 2. **Acquire write lock** — `inner.write()` serialises all mutations.
/// 3. **Re-check state** — a second `state.load(Acquire)` under the lock
///    guards against a concurrent `begin_close` that landed between steps
///    1 and 2. Because `begin_close` transitions the atomic before
///    acquiring the inner lock, the re-check is linearisable.
/// 4. **Check limit** — under the same write guard, compare the live count
///    against the configured `Option<usize>` limit.
/// 5. **Commit** — push/increment within the write guard, then drop the
///    lock.
///
/// This means:
///
/// - **No over-admission**: the live count and the limit are compared
///   inside the same write-lock critical section, so two concurrent
///   `add_task` calls cannot both see `len < limit` and both succeed
///   when only one slot remains.
/// - **No lost removes**: `remove_task`/`remove_child`/`resolve_obligation`
///   acquire the write lock before mutating, so removes are sequenced
///   with respect to additions.
/// - **No stale-close admission**: the double-check on the admission
///   predicate prevents normal work from being added to a region that has
///   already begun closing, even if the optimistic read passed before the
///   state transition. Finalizing only keeps explicit cleanup-task admission
///   open; it does not reopen normal task, obligation, or child-region
///   creation.
/// - **Double-resolve is visible**: `resolve_obligation` asserts in debug
///   builds and records a per-region counter in release builds, so unpaired
///   resolves cannot silently wrap or disappear.

//! Cancel-aware read-write lock with guard cleanup.
//!
//! This RwLock allows multiple readers or a single writer with write-preferring
//! fairness. Acquisition is cancel-safe:
//! - Cancellation while waiting returns an error without acquiring the lock.
//! - Once acquired, guards always release on drop.
//!
//! # Writer-Preference Fairness
//!
//! This RwLock uses a **writer-preference** policy: when a writer is waiting,
//! new read requests are blocked until the writer acquires and releases the lock.
//! This prevents writer starvation under heavy read load, but can cause reader
//! starvation under heavy write load.
//!
//! ## Fairness Characteristics
//!
//! | Scenario                  | Behavior                                      |
//! |---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
//! | No writers waiting        | Readers acquire immediately                   |
//! | Writer waiting            | New readers blocked until writer completes    |
//! | Existing readers + writer | Writer waits for all readers to release       |
//! | Multiple writers          | Writers queue in arrival order (FIFO)         |
//!
//! ## Starvation Analysis
//!
//! - **Writer starvation**: Prevented. Writers block new readers while waiting.
//! - **Reader starvation**: Bounded. After
//!   [`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_WRITERS_BEFORE_READER_BATCH`] writers have been
//!   served from the queue while readers are also queued, the next
//!   `release_writer` forces a reader turn — admitting one queued reader
//!   before another writer can proceed. This bounds reader-side waiting to
//!   at most N writer cycles without letting an older writer sit behind an
//!   unbounded tail of younger readers (br-asupersync-4j40bb).
//!
//! ## When to Use RwLock vs Mutex
//!
//! Prefer **RwLock** when:
//! - Read operations significantly outnumber writes
//! - Read operations are expensive (benefit from parallelism)
//! - Writers are infrequent
//!
//! Prefer **Mutex** when:
//! - Read and write frequency are similar
//! - Critical sections are short
//! - Simplicity is preferred over potential read parallelism
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::sync::RwLock;
//!
//! let lock = RwLock::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
//!
//! // Multiple readers can access concurrently
//! let read1 = lock.read(&cx).await?;
//! let read2 = lock.read(&cx).await?;  // OK: no writers waiting
//!
//! // Writers get exclusive access
//! drop((read1, read2));
//! let mut write = lock.write(&cx).await?;
//! write.push(4);
//! ```

//! Cancel-safe resource pooling with obligation-based return semantics.
//!
//! This module provides a generic resource pooling framework that integrates with
//! asupersync's cancel-safety guarantees. Resources are managed through an
//! obligation-based contract: when a [`PooledResource`] is dropped (or explicitly
//! returned), the underlying resource is automatically sent back to the pool.
//!
//! # Getting Started
//!
//! ## Using the Generic Pool
//!
//! The easiest way to create a pool is with [`GenericPool`] and a factory function:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::sync::{GenericPool, Pool, PoolConfig};
//!
//! // Create a factory that produces resources
//! let factory = || Box::pin(async {
//!     Ok(TcpStream::connect("localhost:5432").await?)
//! });
//!
//! // Create pool with configuration
//! let pool = GenericPool::new(factory, PoolConfig::default());
//!
//! // Acquire and use a resource
//! async fn example(cx: &Cx, pool: &impl Pool<Resource = TcpStream>) {
//!     let conn = pool.acquire(cx).await?;
//!     conn.write_all(b"SELECT 1").await?;
//!     conn.return_to_pool();  // Or just drop - both work!
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Implementing the Pool Trait
//!
//! For custom pool implementations, implement the [`Pool`] trait:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use asupersync::sync::{Pool, PooledResource, PoolStats, PoolFuture, PoolReturnSender};
//! use asupersync::Cx;
//! use std::sync::mpsc;
//!
//! struct MyPool {
//!     return_tx: PoolReturnSender<Vec<u8>>,
//! }
//!
//! impl Pool for MyPool {
//!     type Resource = Vec<u8>;
//!     type Error = std::io::Error;
//!
//!     fn acquire<'a>(&'a self, cx: &'a Cx) -> PoolFuture<'a, Result<PooledResource<Self::Resource>, Self::Error>> {
//!         let resource = vec![0u8; 128];
//!         let pooled = PooledResource::new(resource, self.return_tx.clone());
//!         Box::pin(async move { Ok(pooled) })
//!     }
//!
//!     fn try_acquire(&self) -> Option<PooledResource<Self::Resource>> {
//!         Some(PooledResource::new(vec![0u8; 128], self.return_tx.clone()))
//!     }
//!
//!     fn stats(&self) -> PoolStats { PoolStats::default() }
//!
//!     fn close(&self) -> PoolFuture<'_, ()> {
//!         Box::pin(async move { })
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Configuration Guide
//!
//! [`PoolConfig`] provides fine-grained control over pool behavior:
//!
//! | Option | Default | Description |
//! |--------|---------|-------------|
//! | `min_size` | 1 | Minimum resources to keep in pool |
//! | `max_size` | 10 | Maximum total resources |
//! | `acquire_timeout` | 30s | Timeout for acquire operations |
//! | `idle_timeout` | 600s | Max time a resource can be idle |
//! | `max_lifetime` | 3600s | Max lifetime of a resource |
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let config = PoolConfig::with_max_size(20)
//!     .min_size(5)
//!     .acquire_timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
//!     .idle_timeout(Duration::from_secs(300))
//!     .max_lifetime(Duration::from_secs(1800));
//! ```
//!
//! # Cancel-Safety Patterns
//!
//! The pool is designed for cancel-safety at every phase:
//!
//! ## Cancellation During Wait
//!
//! If a task is cancelled while waiting for a resource (pool at capacity),
//! no resource is leaked. The waiter is simply removed from the queue.
//!
//! ## Cancellation While Holding
//!
//! If a task is cancelled while holding a resource, the [`PooledResource`]'s
//! [`Drop`] implementation ensures the resource is returned to the pool:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async fn risky_operation(cx: &Cx, pool: &DbPool) -> Result<Data> {
//!     let conn = pool.acquire(cx).await?;
//!
//!     // Even if this panics or cx is cancelled, conn will be returned!
//!     let data = conn.query("SELECT * FROM users").await?;
//!
//!     // Explicit return is optional but recommended for clarity
//!     conn.return_to_pool();
//!     Ok(data)
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Discarding Broken Resources
//!
//! If a resource becomes broken (connection error, invalid state), use
//! [`PooledResource::discard()`] to remove it from the pool rather than
//! returning it:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! async fn handle_connection(conn: PooledResource<TcpStream>) {
//!     match conn.write_all(b"PING").await {
//!         Ok(_) => conn.return_to_pool(),
//!         Err(_) => conn.discard(),  // Don't return broken connections
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Obligation Tracking
//!
//! The pool uses an obligation-based model. Once you acquire a resource,
//! you have an "obligation" to return it. This obligation is automatically
//! discharged by either:
//!
//! 1. Calling [`return_to_pool()`](PooledResource::return_to_pool)
//! 2. Calling [`discard()`](PooledResource::discard)
//! 3. Dropping the [`PooledResource`] (implicit return)
//!
//! The obligation prevents double-return bugs and ensures resources
//! are always accounted for.
//!
//! # Metrics and Monitoring
//!
//! Use [`Pool::stats()`] to monitor pool health:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let stats = pool.stats();
//!
//! tracing::info!(
//!     active = stats.active,
//!     idle = stats.idle,
//!     total = stats.total,
//!     max_size = stats.max_size,
//!     waiters = stats.waiters,
//!     acquisitions = stats.total_acquisitions,
//!     "Pool health check"
//! );
//!
//! // Alert if pool is starved
//! if stats.waiters > 10 {
//!     tracing::warn!(waiters = stats.waiters, "Pool congestion detected");
//! }
//!
//! // Alert if utilization is high
//! let utilization = stats.active as f64 / stats.max_size as f64;
//! if utilization > 0.9 {
//!     tracing::warn!(utilization = %format!("{:.0}%", utilization * 100.0), "Pool near capacity");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Key Metrics
//!
//! | Metric | Meaning |
//! |--------|---------|
//! | `active` | Resources currently held by tasks |
//! | `idle` | Resources waiting to be used |
//! | `total` | Total resources (active + idle) |
//! | `waiters` | Tasks blocked waiting for resources |
//! | `total_acquisitions` | Lifetime acquisition count |
//! | `total_wait_time` | Cumulative wait time |
//!
//! # Troubleshooting
//!
//! ## Pool Exhaustion
//!
//! If `waiters` is high and `total == max_size`, consider:
//! - Increasing `max_size`
//! - Reducing hold time (return resources faster)
//! - Adding circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
//!
//! ## Resource Leaks
//!
//! If `total` grows but `idle` stays low, resources may be:
//! - Held too long (check `held_duration()`)
//! - Not being returned properly (ensure `return_to_pool()` or drop is called)
//!
//! ## Stale Resources
//!
//! If connections are timing out, consider:
//! - Reducing `idle_timeout` to evict stale resources faster
//! - Reducing `max_lifetime` to force refresh
//! - Adding health checks before returning resources to pool

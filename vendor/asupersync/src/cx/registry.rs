//! Registry capability and name lease obligations (Spork).
//!
//! This module defines:
//! 1. **Capability plumbing** (`bd-133q8`): the registry is not a global singleton;
//!    it is carried as an explicit capability on [`Cx`](crate::cx::Cx).
//! 2. **Name ownership as lease obligations** (`bd-25f52`): registering a name
//!    acquires a [`NameLease`] backed by the graded obligation system. The lease
//!    must be released (committed) or will be aborted on task/region cleanup.
//!
//! # Name Lease Lifecycle
//!
//! ```text
//! reserve_name() → NameLease (Active)
//!                        │
//!                        ├─ release() ──► Released (obligation committed)
//!                        │
//!                        └─ abort()   ──► Aborted  (obligation aborted, e.g. task cancelled)
//!                        │
//!                        └─ (drop)    ──► PANIC (obligation leaked — drop bomb)
//! ```
//!
//! The two-phase design prevents stale names: a region cannot close until all
//! name leases held by tasks in that region are resolved.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! All operations are trace-visible via [`RegistryEvent`]. In the lab runtime
//! the registry enforces deterministic ordering on simultaneous registrations.
//!

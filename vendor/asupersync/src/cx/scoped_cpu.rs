//! Lending CPU scope: scoped OS threads that BORROW run-local state
//! while observing asupersync cancellation and budgets.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Every task-spawning path ([`Cx::spawn_in`], [`Cx::spawn_blocking`],
//! [`Cx::spawn_blocking_in`]) requires `Send + 'static` closures, but
//! data-parallel fork-join kernels (the FrankenSim `TilePool` class of
//! consumer) deliberately borrow run-local state — kernels, deques,
//! output bands — and join every worker before returning. Forcing those
//! borrows behind `Arc` erases the lifetime discipline that makes the
//! executor auditable; wrapping raw [`std::thread::scope`] with no `Cx`
//! wiring hides the workers from cancellation and budget enforcement.
//!
//! # Soundness
//!
//! This is the [`std::thread::scope`] pattern verbatim: the API is a
//! FUNCTION that only returns after every spawned child has joined, not
//! a guard value, so the "leak the joiner" hazard of guard-based scoped
//! tasks cannot arise. Borrowed (non-`'static`) captures are sound for
//! exactly the reason they are sound in `std`.
//!
//! # Scope-tree honesty (Decalogue P7)
//!
//! No task is created here. The scoped threads execute as an
//! implementation detail of the CALLING task, each holding a clone of
//! its [`Cx`], so:
//!
//! - cancellation requested on the task (or its region) is observed by
//!   every child at its next [`CpuCx::checkpoint`] — the same
//!   `fast_cancel` fast path every checkpoint uses;
//! - budget exhaustion (deadline, poll quota, cost) surfaces through
//!   the same checkpoint;
//! - the region cannot close under the workers because the calling
//!   task is inside `scoped_cpu` until every worker has joined —
//!   request → drain → finalize holds by construction.
//!
//! # Blocking discipline
//!
//! [`Cx::scoped_cpu`] BLOCKS the calling thread until the scope
//! completes. Call it from synchronous compute code (its intended
//! consumer) or from inside [`Cx::spawn_blocking`]; calling it from an
//! async task polled on an executor thread stalls that executor thread
//! for the duration, exactly as any long blocking section would.

//! Race combinator: run multiple operations, first wins.
//!
//! The race combinator runs multiple operations concurrently.
//! When the first one completes, all others are cancelled and drained.
//!
//! # Critical Invariant: Losers Are Drained
//!
//! Unlike other runtimes that abandon losers, asupersync always drains them:
//!
//! ```text
//! race(f1, f2):
//!   t1 ← spawn(f1)
//!   t2 ← spawn(f2)
//!   (winner, loser) ← select_first_complete(t1, t2)
//!   cancel(loser)
//!   await(loser)  // CRITICAL: drain the loser
//!   return winner.outcome
//! ```
//!
//! This ensures resources held by losers are properly released.
//!
//! # Algebraic Laws
//!
//! - Commutativity: `race(a, b) ≃ race(b, a)` (same winner set, different selection)
//! - Identity: `race(a, never) ≃ a` (never = future that never completes)
//! - Associativity: `race(race(a, b), c) ≃ race(a, race(b, c))`
//!
//! # Outcome Semantics
//!
//! The winner's outcome drives ordinary success, error, and cancellation.
//! Losers are cancelled and drained before returning. Non-panicking loser
//! outcomes are retained for invariant verification; loser panics are surfaced
//! by fail-fast conversion helpers so drained branch panics are not silently
//! swallowed.

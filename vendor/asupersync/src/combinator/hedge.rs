//! Hedge combinator for latency hedging.
//!
//! The hedge combinator implements latency hedging - start a primary task, and if
//! it does not complete within a deadline, speculatively start a backup. Return
//! whichever completes first. This is a key pattern for reducing tail latency in
//! distributed systems.
//!
//! # Motivation
//!
//! P99 latencies often exceed P50 by 10-100x. Hedging trades compute cost for latency:
//! - Primary starts immediately
//! - If deadline expires without completion, backup launches
//! - First to complete wins; loser is cancelled
//! - Total latency bounded by min(primary, backup) rather than max
//!
//! # Semantics Note
//!
//! This standalone future returns as soon as a winner is known. The losing branch
//! is dropped and represented as `Outcome::Cancelled(CancelReason::race_loser())`.
//! Runtime-level integrations that require explicit loser draining must enforce
//! that policy externally.
//!
//! ```text
//! hedge(primary, backup_fn, deadline):
//!   t1 <- spawn(primary)
//!   case:
//!     | t1 completes before deadline -> return t1.outcome
//!     | deadline fires ->
//!         t2 <- spawn(backup_fn())
//!         (winner, loser) <- select_first_complete(t1, t2)
//!         cancel(loser)
//!         return winner.outcome
//! ```
//!
//! # Algebraic Properties
//!
//! - If primary always completes before deadline: `hedge(p, b, d) ≃ p`
//! - If primary never completes before deadline: `hedge(p, b, d) ≃ race(p, b)`
//! - Budget composition: `hedge_budget = primary_budget + backup_budget + deadline`
//!
//! # Cancellation Handling
//!
//! - If caller requests cancel before primary completes: cancel primary, never spawn backup
//! - If caller requests cancel during race: cancel both (loser surfaced as cancelled outcome)

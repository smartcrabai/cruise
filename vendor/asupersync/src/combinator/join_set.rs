//! Dynamic-arity structured fan-out: spawn N tasks into a region and collect
//! their results.
//!
//! [`JoinSet`] is the region-aware, cancel-correct analog of the
//! ecosystem-standard `JoinSet` type. Members are spawned through the v2
//! [`Cx::spawn_in`](crate::cx::Cx::spawn_in) path into the **owning scope's
//! region**, so the region's quiescence guarantee still applies: the region
//! cannot close while a member is live, and dropping the set is a
//! *cancellation request* to every still-running member (region close is the
//! quiescence backstop that guarantees no orphans).
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use asupersync::{main, prelude::*};
//!
//! #[main]
//! async fn main(cx: &Cx) {
//!     let mut set = JoinSet::in_cx(cx);
//!     for i in 0..10_u32 {
//!         set.spawn(cx, move |_| async move { Ok::<_, ()>(i) }).expect("spawn");
//!     }
//!     let total = set.join_all(cx).await.into_iter().fold(0, |sum, outcome| {
//!         sum + outcome.expect("member ok")
//!     });
//!     assert_eq!(total, 45);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The API covers the common server patterns: [`JoinSet::in_cx`] for the
//! current region, [`JoinSet::new`] for an explicit scope, [`JoinSet::spawn`]
//! and [`JoinSet::spawn_local`] for member admission, [`JoinSet::join_next`]
//! for completion-order collection, [`JoinSet::join_all`] for spawn-order
//! collection, [`JoinSet::cancel_all`] for explicit drain after cancellation,
//! [`JoinSet::summary`] for severity aggregation, structured
//! `join_set.spawn` trace fields that bind each member to its parent set, and
//! abort-on-drop for best-effort cancellation requests.
//!
//! Child-region isolation is state-threaded through [`Scope::region`]:
//! construct [`JoinSet::new`] with the child scope inside the region body.
//! [`JoinSet::new`] and [`JoinSet::in_cx`] intentionally reuse an existing
//! region instead of allocating a hidden quiescence boundary.
//!
//! # There is no separate `TaskGroup`
//!
//! `JoinSet` **is** this runtime's task-group primitive, and no `TaskGroup`
//! type is planned (`br-asupersync-ufdab2`). If you came here looking for one,
//! stop looking: everything a task group is normally wanted for is already on
//! this type — region-owned members, completion-order [`JoinSet::join_next`],
//! spawn-order [`JoinSet::join_all`], drained [`JoinSet::cancel_all`],
//! [`JoinSet::summary`] severity aggregation, and abort-on-drop.
//!
//! A `TaskGroup` that merely renamed or aliased `JoinSet` would be a
//! compatibility shim, which this project does not add, and it would leave
//! agents choosing between two names for one concept.
//!
//! The one genuinely different design — a group that *owns* a child region by
//! construction, so that cancelling the group is a region cancel and leaving it
//! is a quiescence boundary — is deliberately **not** what `JoinSet` does.
//! `JoinSet` shares the caller's region. When you want the group itself to be a
//! structure boundary, compose it explicitly rather than reaching for a
//! different type:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // The group IS the quiescence boundary: the child region cannot close
//! // until every member is done, and cancelling the region cancels them all.
//! scope
//!     .region(&mut state, &cx, FailFast, |child, state| async move {
//!         let mut set = JoinSet::new(&child);
//!         // ... set.spawn(...) ...
//!         set.join_all(&cx).await
//!     })

//! Metamorphic test for **LAW-RACE-JOIN-DIST**
//! (`asupersync_v4_formal_semantics.md §7`):
//!
//! ```text
//! race(join(a, b), join(a, c))  ≃  join(a, race(b, c))
//! ```
//!
//! Classified in `combinator/laws.rs` as `SeverityLevelOnly` — the law holds
//! at the severity lattice (`Ok < Err < Cancelled < Panicked`) but not at
//! the value level, because the concrete winner of a race depends on polling
//! order. This module discharges the severity-level claim and the two
//! execution-side invariants that a rewriter applying the rule must respect:
//!
//! 1. **MR-SEV (severity equivalence)** — exhaustively enumerate outcome
//!    triples `(a, b, c) ∈ Σ³` where `Σ = {Ok, Err, Cancelled, Panicked}`
//!    and assert `severity(LHS) == severity(RHS)` for every triple (64 cases).
//! 2. **MR-RUN-ONCE (no speculative re-execution)** — when the rewriter picks
//!    the RHS shape, the shared subexpression `a` must be polled exactly once
//!    (no duplicate side-effects). The LHS shape, by contrast, structurally
//!    contains two independent `a` sub-futures, so the rewriter's obligation
//!    is to collapse them.
//! 3. **MR-MASK (cancel masking of losers)** — the loser of the inner race
//!    `race(b, c)` in the RHS becomes `Cancelled(race_loser)` and must not
//!    escalate the aggregate severity beyond what the LHS produces.
//!
//! The full Mazurkiewicz trace-equivalence check described in the bead is
//! noted as future work; it requires a LabRuntime-driven execution capture
//! and belongs with the DPOR trace canonicalization harness in
//! `src/trace/canonicalize.rs`. The three MRs below are sufficient to
//! certify the rewrite engine's use of LAW-RACE-JOIN-DIST at the severity
//! level the law claims.
